1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,030
So at the bottom of the Edit Profile
screen, is the Professional section.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,530
Just like a regular user can
have attended multiple schools,

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,900
a regular user may have
had several employers.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,010
Here you see the screen that the admin
user uses to maintain a list of

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,050
employers.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,900
So, we have an entity type of Employer.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,770
Employers have the property
type Employer Name, and

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,210
Employer Names are unique.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,500
As we saw from the Edit Profile screen,

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,530
a regular user may have had multiple
employers over time, and, obviously,

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,730
a particular employer may have multiple
regular users working for that employer.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,290
Job title is not maintained
by the administrative user.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,260
It can be anything that
the regular user wants to insert.

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,082
It's a multi-value, because over time
a particular regular user may have

15
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:53,260
held different job titles for
the same employer.
