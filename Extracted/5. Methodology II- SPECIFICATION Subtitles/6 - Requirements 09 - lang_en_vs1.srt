1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
Let's look at the two screens that are
used to request and accept friendships.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,600
So a particular user can request
multiple other users to be friends.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,420
For each one of those requests, there is
an instance of the request relationship.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,764
So one regular user may have requested
several different friendships.

5
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:20,920
In the pending request here,

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,610
the list of people who have
requested to be friends with you.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,720
Here is the list of people that
you have requested as friends.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,317
When a user accepts a request, that adds
an instance to the accept relationship.

9
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:38,540
So a particular regular user
may have accepted requests for

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,340
friendships from multiple
different users.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,930
The date connected records the date
that the invitation was accepted.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,640
Notice in this requirement it's very
interesting that friendship here

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,500
is not always reciprocal.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,710
Just because Emily is
a friend with Sarah,

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,500
does not necessarily imply that
Sarah is a friend with Emily.
