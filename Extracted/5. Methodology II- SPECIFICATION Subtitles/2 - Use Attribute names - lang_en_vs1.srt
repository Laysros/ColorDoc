00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,300
From the edit profile screen,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,590
we see that several additional
attributes are needed.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,220
Sex, Birthdate, Current City, and

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,530
Hometown, are all single
value property types.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,370
Interests is a multi-value property type
modeled here by the double ellipses.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,230
Notice that I'm very, very careful

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,300
to use the names that are provided
on the documents in my EER diagram.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,620
That way, I tie the diagram very,
very closely to the real world.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,352
The idea is that the entity relationship
diagram really becomes a high

10
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:36,206
quality model of reality.

11
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:40,230
Reality represented by the documents
that people of the application use.
