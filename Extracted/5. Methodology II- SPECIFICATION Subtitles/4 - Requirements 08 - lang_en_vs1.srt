1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,990
Looking further down
the edit profile screen,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,640
we see the education section of it.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,170
Looking at the requirements
from our customer is a snippet,

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,700
says a list of schools from
which the user can select

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,280
is maintained by
the system administrator.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,090
So in other words,

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,170
we have a list of schools as
an entity type in the database.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,670
Further says that school
names are unique,

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,920
that means that school name is
an identifying attribute of school.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,590
It says that user can have any number
of schools associated with him or her.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,549
So that means for

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,990
a particular user, many schools
can be associated with that user.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,130
Of course, for a particular school
there may be many regular users who

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,040
have attended that school, so given one
school there may be many regular users

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,900
associated with that school.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,340
In a unique relationship instance
between a regular user and

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,440
a school, there's year graduated
date associated with it.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,640
Since a regular user may
attempt the same school for

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,110
many different levels of education,
like bachelors and masters, for

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,590
example, the year
graduated is a multi-value.

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,380
So here's the screen that an admin user
uses to maintain a list of schools and

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,350
their types.

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,900
Each school must have a school type.

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,220
So the relationship here is mandatory.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,500
A school type, of course, can be
the type from any schools on the list.
