00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:03,998
Having now addressed the data
formats of the property types,

2
00:00:03,998 --> 00:00:05,885
lets talk about constraints.

3
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:09,654
Here are some examples of constraints
in the particular application we

4
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:11,010
are creating now.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,840
For example,

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,380
DateConnected must be NULL until
a friend's request has been accepted.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,440
Another example is you cannot
be friend with yourself.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,980
So whenever there is an insertion into
the database to establish a friendship,

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,460
the application needs to check that
this constraint is not violated.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,120
You could have a constraint saying that
only comments on the status of friends

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,020
is allowed.

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,520
In other words, if you try to submit
a comment on a person that is not your

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,275
friend, then the application
system should reject that.

14
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:47,291
To be a little bit more specific about
the kind of constraints we are looking

15
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,353
for, remember we have already
expressed constraints in

16
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:52,795
the Extended Entity Relationship
diagram.

17
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:56,023
And by specifying what
the data formatting would be,

18
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:58,975
we should not include
those on the constraints.

19
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,590
So where does that leave us?

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,780
Well, it basically leaves
us with a set of rules

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,320
that we can describe in the database
that we can't format our way out of.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,150
So there's only one place left to
do it and that is to program it

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,270
into the application program so
that constraints like this are enforced.
