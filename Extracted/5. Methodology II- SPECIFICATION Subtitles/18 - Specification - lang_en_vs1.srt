1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,210
This basically complete
the specification phase

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,800
of our database development methodology.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,810
We have generated an extended
energy relationship diagram,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,260
we have looked at data formats,
and we have looked at constraints.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,050
And based on that, we then looked
at the test decomposition and

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,350
wrote abstract code for the tasks.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,400
We now need to take a little detour.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,960
When we come back again,
we're going to proceed with a design.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,424
In the design,
we're going to translate the extended

10
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:31,198
relationship diagram to
a Relational Database Schema.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:35,326
And we're going to take the abstract
code for the test and put in the SQL

12
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:39,891
that is necessary, in order for the test
to do to the relational database,

13
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:44,400
what our abstract code did to the
extended entity relationship diagram.
