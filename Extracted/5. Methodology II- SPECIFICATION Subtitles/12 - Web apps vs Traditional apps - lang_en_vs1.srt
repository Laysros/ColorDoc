00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,470
Before we look at some examples of tests
decompensation, let us briefly talk

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,080
about web based applications,
versus traditional applications.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,440
Web based applications
are almost completely stateless.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,417
The amount of state may be as
little at the login information for

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,720
a session user.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,250
There may be a small amount of
click stream data that's available

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,890
in order to proceed
with the application.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,560
Things, however, for
web-based applications are changing.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,064
With new technologies
such as Web 2.0 and

10
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:36,955
AJAX it is now possible to provide
much more state with the application.

11
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:40,225
Because of that web applications
are beginning to act

12
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:42,125
more like traditional applications.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,860
What is it we have been able to
do with traditional applications?

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,450
Well, in a traditional application,

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,710
it is much easier to manage local
states separate from the database.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,360
That means that a whole bunch of
changes can be collected, before they

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,750
are submitted to the Database
Management System for execution.

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,820
That means, that there is not
a roundtrip to the database needed

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,600
every single time a minor
thing is changed.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,080
So it's as you have to do in a web app.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,540
Traditionally applications are much
better to support control of

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,160
ACID transaction properties,
so that's a big advantage too.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,310
So fortunately,

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,080
web app technology is moving closer
to traditional app technology.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,660
An understanding of this is
necessary as we consider examples

26
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,910
of tasty composition.
