1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,500
The first step of the task is to
execute the View Profile task.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,510
That task will populate the School and
Employer drop down lists.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,340
The next step is to sit back and
do nothing.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,730
As long as no one pushes one of
the buttons to add or delete or

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,170
save, we don't need to do anything.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,090
So sit around, do nothing.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,490
When a button is pushed,
then do the following.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,350
If the button that's pushed is
the Save Personal Information,

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,610
then update the personal information and
run View Profile again

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,440
as you did in the beginning in
order to display the new state.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,370
If it's the Delete This School
button that's pushed,

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,910
then delete the school and run
View Profile to redisplay the screen.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,560
If it's Delete This Job,

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,650
then delete the job, run the View
Profile to redisplay the screen.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,040
If it's the Add Another School button
that's pushed, then, one, View Profile

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,450
again and display the added profile
screen with room to add another school.

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,270
If it's Add Another Job button that's
pushed, then run View Profile again,

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,500
redisplay the edit profile screen
with room to add another job.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,820
If the Save School button is pushed,
then add the school to the database,

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,480
rerun View Profile, and
redisplay the edit profile screen.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,830
If it's the save job
button that's pushed,

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,710
then add the job, rerun view profile
to redisplay the edit profile screen.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,450
Finally, if the Cancel button is pushed,
then run View Profile for

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,130
the current user and
display that screen.

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,060
In this and the previous example,
I've used the following notation.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,851
I used bold, underline for
the task definition.

27
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:41,580
I use bold for task calls,
so it says View Profile.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,510
I use italics for names of buttons,
such as Delete This School,

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,815
Delete This job, etc.
