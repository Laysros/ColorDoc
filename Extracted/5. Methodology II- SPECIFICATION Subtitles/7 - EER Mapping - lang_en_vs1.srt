00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,540
Adding it all together, here is
the EER diagram we have arrived at.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,110
We have a set of users.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,450
The users are uniquely
identified by email.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,010
Users have passwords and

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,420
they have names that are composed
from first and last names.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,080
A user must either be a regular user or
an admin user, but cannot be both.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,810
Therefore, the constraint is disjoint.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,330
Regular users have profiles with sex,
birthdate, current city, and

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,270
hometown, and a list of interests.

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,260
Admin users only have a single property
name the last time they logged in.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,250
Regular users may have
attended multiple schools.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,820
And a particular school may have
multiple regular users that attended it.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,950
A school must have a school type.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,700
Schools are identified by school name,
school type identified by type name.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,720
A regular user may have worked for many
employers and a particular employer of

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,690
course may have many regular
users working for that employer.

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,850
A particular employer could hold
multiple titles over time for

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,300
the same employer.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,880
Employee names are unique.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,500
You have the friendships.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,410
Regular users request
multiple friendships.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,590
And regular users can accept
multiple friendships.

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,790
Date connected reflects the date that
our friendship request was accepted.
