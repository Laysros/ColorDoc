1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,940
Here's one more requirement for

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,460
the cosmos we're building
the application for.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:10,590
It's says that all GT online users
except admin users have a profile.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,970
What did we learn from that?

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,280
We learned that they are not just users.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,670
They are also admin users.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,240
The way we specify that is as follows.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,150
The users actually has two subtypes.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,580
It has regular users and admin users.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,200
The regular users are those that have

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,770
this additional information in their
profile whereas admin users do not.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,970
An additional requirement
from the customer says that

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,800
administrative users have some of
the same information as regular users,

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,340
namely e-mail address, password,
first name, and last name.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,980
So it is okay to keep those as
properties of user in general.

16
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,230
Since both regular users and
admin users have them,

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,800
they would then be able to inherit those
properties from the super type user.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,560
It is also further specified here
that the admin users do not have all

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,769
the other properties that are in
the profile of regular users.

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,850
Then it says a user must be either
an administrator or a regular user.

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,250
That must, is reflected by
the mandatory relationship here.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,610
And it says the user must be
either an administrator or

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,050
a regular user, but never both.

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,550
That means that the constraint
here on the super sub type is

25
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,430
a disjointness constraint.

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,650
The only additional
attribute an admin user has,

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,670
other than those inherited from a user,
is that of the last login date and time.
