1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,580
So as our first example
of Task Decomposition,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,140
let's now try to use our rules of thumb.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,770
On the View Profile test,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,300
which is the test that supports
the View Profile screen.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,850
So by looking at the screen here,
we notice that there are three lookups.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,190
There's a lookup of
the personal information.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,170
There's a lookup of
the education information, and

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,600
finally the professional information for
a regular user.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,050
All three lookups are read-only.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,830
In other words, there's no operation or
update of the database that takes place.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,630
All three are enabled by a user's
login or a friend's lookup.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,020
All three have the same frequency.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,140
A fairly large number of schema
constructs are needed for this task.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,030
Just look in the EER diagram and see how
big a portion the personal information

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,100
covers the education information and
the professional information.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,860
Consistency is really not critical.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,660
So even if there is an update
going on here on the database

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,580
by some other user, whether you
get the absolute 100% up to date

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,270
version of the personal information,
the education information, and

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,890
professional information
is not really important.

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,070
Another important observation is,
that these can be done in any order.

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,030
They do not need to be done in
the order of personal, then education,

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,180
then professional information.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,300
So there's flexibility in
the order of execution.

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,950
However all three of the must be done

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,890
in order to display the information
on the View Profile screen.

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,120
So another task is needed to make
sure that all three things get done.

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,760
Most of these are good indicators
that the task should be split up in

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,590
three subtasks.

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,710
So we take the View Profile task and

31
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,050
split it up in the View Personal,
View Education, and View Professional
