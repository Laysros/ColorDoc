00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,420
Please notice that the way
I just summarized that

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,870
extended entity relationship diagram
was quite mechanical in nature.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,710
It would actually be possible to write
a program that would take as input and

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,020
extend it into relationship diagram and

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,700
then read out in English
exactly what it means.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,430
No more, no less.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,380
When you are talking with your customer
about your database specification,

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,800
they will not be able to understand the
extended entity relationship diagram.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,135
They might be able able to understand
this English representation

10
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:34,405
of that diagram.

11
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:39,625
Of course we all understand that when
reading this, you need to pay very

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:44,595
very careful attention to every single
word that's in that description.
