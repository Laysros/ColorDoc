1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,760
So the first step is to find
the current user using User Email.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,960
We can now, having found that user,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,210
we can display on the output document
View Profile the name of the user.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,184
Again, using the User Email
we can now move down and

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,135
check the RegularUser entity type and

6
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:23,950
by looking at the property types here
we are then able to display Sex,

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,870
BirthDate, CurrentCity,
Hometown and Interests.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,100
That takes care of
the personal information.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,710
Now we gotta go through each school
the user has attended and display that

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,950
information and each job the user has
had and display that information.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,880
So let's first take a look
at the school information.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,100
So we start with a RegularUser and

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,430
that leads us to N number of
schools that the user has attended.

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,830
So for each one of those, display
the school name and the year graduated.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,220
Find the SchoolType and display that.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,280
For each employer,
start with a RegularUser,

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,840
find the N employers that that
RegularUser has worked for.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,195
And for each one of them, display
the EmployerName and the JobTitle.

19
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:13,869
So that's the abstract code, there is
no formal syntax for abstract code.

20
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:16,230
Every one has his or her own style.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,120
But this is fairly formal and fairly
precise and fairly complete description

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,020
of what needs to take place for
each one of these subsets here.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,220
And it is sort of the penultimate
step before writing this in SQL

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,400
on a real relational database
when we get that far.
