00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
Let me give you a brief history of SQL or Sequel as many people call it.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,165
SQL was actually the original name standing for Structured English Query Language.

3
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,140
SQL was part of System R which was

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,480
a research relation database prototype released by IBM in 1973.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,500
SQL was created by Chamberlin and Boyce.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,690
So, name was changed to SQL which stands for Structured Query Language.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,115
SQL is based on relational tuple calculus and some algebra.

8
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,780
By the way, do you know what mermaid's square?

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,120
Algebra.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,740
They are both ANSI and ISO standards for SQL.

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,820
SQL1, first version was standardized in '86,

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,570
and then a revision in '89,

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,420
what is now we referred to as SQL2,

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,170
was published in '92,

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,945
and in '99 followed SQL3.

16
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:09,200
There have been a number of revisions here every two to three years since then.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,630
In most of the cases,

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,035
the fundamental part of SQL is as good with a standard is the same,

19
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:19,980
but these revisions have added a lot of functionality for temporal queries,

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,005
spatial queries, and other things.

21
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,420
SQL is supported by a large,

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,355
large number of database products.

23
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:32,970
IBMs, DB2 which was actually a commercial version of System R,

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,140
Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server,

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,730
MySQL, and many, many more,

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:44,770
and they all support the standard SQL or they do that. We'll get back to that.
