1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
Looking at a selection with a composite where clause.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,420
Let's say, we want to find all regular users who either

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,300
have the same CurrenCity and HomeTown or who live in Atlanta.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,100
The rescue out for that would be as follows: select all the columns from regular user,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,040
where either the CurrentCity equal HomeTown or HomeTown equal Atlanta.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,375
So, let's take a look at the regular user table.

7
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,190
Does the HomeTown equal Atlanta?

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,350
Yes it does. So, user one is part of the result.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,585
Are CurrentCity and HomeTown the same?

10
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:33,035
No. Does HomeTown equal Atlanta?

11
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,145
No. So, user three is not part of the result. Is user 4?

12
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:38,945
Yes. Is user 6?

13
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:43,520
Yes. So, starting out with this table this is your result.
