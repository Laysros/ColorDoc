1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,275
Let's look at a projection now.

2
00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:06,445
Let's say, we want to find just some of the columns of the regular user table,

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:07,905
namely email, birth year,

4
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:10,225
and sex for regular users in Atlanta.

5
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:11,845
So, it is a projection.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,030
We can't use to star wild card.

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,570
It is a projection on only some of the columns of the regular user table.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,740
So, in other words,

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,610
the result from this query here is going to have three columns,

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,740
e-mail, birth year, and sex in that order.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,560
So, going through then the regular user table,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,320
we're going to have to look at where hometown equals Atlanta.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,625
It does here, so that means that user1,

14
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,925
85 and male is at row in the result.

15
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,040
User4 hometown is Atlanta,

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,820
so user4, 88, and male is in the result.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,370
Finally, user6, 88 female is in the result.
