1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
So, let's say we are doing the exact same query,

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,970
but we only want to return the groups that have more than one interest.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,810
The way we do that is that,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,600
in addition to the group by clause on email here,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,605
we have a condition on the group saying,

6
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:18,045
"Having NumInt greater than one."

7
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:20,745
Other than that, the query is exactly the same.

8
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:22,800
If you look at the results here,

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,015
you will also see the result is the same,

10
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:27,420
except the user4, who had

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,770
just a single interest does no longer appear in the result because of this clause.
