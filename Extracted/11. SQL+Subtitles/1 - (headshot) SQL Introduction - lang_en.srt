1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,110
So, now we get to SQL.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,005
SQL is sort of the lingua franca of databases.

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:10,065
Most databases support some form of SQL.

4
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:12,430
Mike Stonebraker also called SQL,

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,190
the intergalactic data speak some years ago,

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,255
and that is really still true.

7
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:23,255
Most data sit in relational databases and are accessed through SQL.

8
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:29,310
Although, XML is used quite a lot to describe interfaces and to exchange data,

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,520
the real data still sit in SQL databases.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,200
So, now on to SQL.
