1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,010
Sorting, oh no.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,140
Another one of those practical things.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,985
But if you print out from an SQL query,

4
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:11,080
say a phone number list,

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,910
don't you want that sorted by say, last name?

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,745
So from a practical perspective,

7
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:18,040
although it's not part of algebra and calculus,

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,930
you do need ability to sort an output.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,030
Let's say you want to find data about regular users who are males,

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,710
and you want to sort the data by ascending current city.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,300
So, we select emails, sex,

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,145
and currency city from regular user for males

13
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:35,735
and we order the result by current city ascending.

14
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,685
So, what is the result going to look like?

15
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:40,160
Well, it's only the males that are involved here.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,420
So, this tuple is going to qualify,

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,005
this tuple is going to qualify,

18
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,040
this one, and this one.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,360
So, we know there are four tuples in the result.

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,035
Now, it needs to be sorted by current city.

21
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:54,325
So, the first output will be the row Austin,

22
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:58,345
then San Diego, then San Francisco, and finally Seattle.

23
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:01,160
It is possible to sort on multiple columns.

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,720
You can sort ascending and or descending.
