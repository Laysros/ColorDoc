1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,005
Finally, set operator Except expressed in SQL.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,615
I want to find all cities that are CurrentCity's,

3
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:09,870
but we want to exclude those that are HomeTown's.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,875
Again, we want to set return without duplicates.

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,845
So, same deal, Select CurrentCity from RegUser.

6
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:17,910
Select HomeTownfrom RegUser.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,460
Return the result of the first query

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,760
except those that appear in the Result of the second query.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,450
So, let's look at what the result of this query is.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,110
So, Seattle is in the Result as you see up here because it's not a HomeTown for anyone.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,225
Las Vegas is in the Result. Same reason.

12
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:40,890
San Diego is not in the Result because it's a HomeTown for User form.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,970
San Francisco is in the Result,

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,435
it's not a HomeTown for any of these users.

15
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:49,135
San Diego, is still not in it because it's a hometown.

16
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:53,540
Las Vegas, already is in it and there are no duplicate returned.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,160
So, the result of this query in this table is here.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,330
Let's now take a look at what happens if we want to consider duplicates.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,810
So, the same way we did before instead of writing Except to return a Set,

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,685
we now say Except All and the number of occurrences in

21
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:13,065
the two operand intermediate results will now play a role in what comes back.

22
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,430
So, Seattle as before, is in the Result.

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,015
It's not a HomeTown for anyone.

24
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:19,295
This Las Vegas is in the Result.

25
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,960
It's not a HomeTown for anyone.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,720
San Diego is going to be in the result because San Diego

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,065
appears here and here that's twice and it appears one time over here,

28
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:30,600
2 minus 1 is 1.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,840
So, San Diego is now in the Result.

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,965
San Francisco is there for the same reason it was before.

31
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,300
How about Las Vegas?

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,540
Well, we already have Las Vegas here.

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,220
It's not a HomeTown for anyone.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,165
So, the second time it appears here,

35
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,330
it's also in the Result.
