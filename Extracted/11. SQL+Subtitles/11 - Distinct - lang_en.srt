00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
When we looked at Relational Algebra and Calculus I

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,390
emphasized many many times that relations are sets,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,195
and that the result of a query is always a relation and therefore, a set.

4
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:15,090
In SQL, tables may have duplicate rows.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,110
Let me talk about the keyword 'Distinct'.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,430
So let's say I want to find a sex for regular users in Atlanta.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,610
The query to do that is as follows.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,300
SELECT sex, FROM RegularUser,

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,480
WHERE HomeTown equals 'Atlanta'.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,615
Looking at the RegularUser table and the rows where HomeTown equals Atlanta,

11
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:37,385
you see that user one satisfies that.

12
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:40,070
So, male is part of the result.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,575
So is male a second time for user four and so is female for user six.

14
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,090
So here, male appears twice.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,400
If you want to avoid the duplication,

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,610
here's the way to do that.

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,740
You use the keyword Distinct around the attribute that you want returned.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,360
So, in this case, the result is the same except duplicates are eliminated.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,480
So, you get just the row male and female returned.
