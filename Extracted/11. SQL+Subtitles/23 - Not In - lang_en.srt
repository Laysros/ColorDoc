00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,630
The final SQL concept I want to introduce to you is the concept of nested queries.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,245
We are going to illustrate for you three different types of nested queries.

3
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:12,135
So, let's look at a simple example.

4
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:16,180
Let's find email and interests for RegularUser's in Atlanta.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,450
So, let's look at the UserInterests table.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,730
Consider first the first row,

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,040
will then contribute to the result.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,660
Well it's user one and user one lives in Atlanta satisfying

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,250
the nested query and therefore user one and music will contribute to the result.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,070
What about this one here? We already know user one lives in Atlanta.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,225
So, user one reading is in here,

12
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:41,345
user one tennis is in here,

13
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,660
what about user two?

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,165
Well, user two does not have hometown Atlanta,

15
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:49,050
so user two does not contribute to the result.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,735
Neither does user three who has hometown Portland or user four lives in Atlanta,

17
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:58,865
so user four and DIY contributes to the result.

18
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,245
You can think about it slightly differently.

19
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:05,195
You could say, in this case here you would look at the inner query

20
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:09,270
and say SELECT email FROM RegularUser WHERE HomeTown equals Atlanta.

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,430
You're going to see, that only the user one

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,820
and user four are going to count in this example.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,360
So, when you look at the outer query,

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,510
you just need to check whether the email

25
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,850
for which you are considering listing email and interest,

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,090
whether that's in the result of the inner query consisting of user one and user four.

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,830
You could say there's no correlation necessarily between the two which

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,715
you are considering in the outer query and those you are looking at in the inner query.

29
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:45,780
The inner query is the same we got this off which row you look at in the outer query.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,220
We'll see that differently in later examples,

31
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,610
and alternative of course for this very very simple query is that you just take

32
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,370
the UserInterests and RegularUser table represented by alias I and U,

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,810
and you just join them on matching emails,

34
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,630
select where hometown is Atlanta and then project on email and interest.
