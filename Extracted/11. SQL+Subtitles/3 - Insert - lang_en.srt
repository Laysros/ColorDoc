1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,165
So let's first look at an example of insert.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:10,595
So this insertion here inserts into user interests a table with the values user12@gt.edu,

3
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:15,645
reading and five as the values of e-mail interest and the since age.

4
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:19,085
So if you start out with a user interest table like this,

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,680
then after the insertion,

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,935
the user12@gt.edu reading and five will have been added.

7
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:29,220
It's interesting to observe that inserting into

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,210
the database will only insert a single row at a time,

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,420
unless the insertion contains a clear expression on the database that identifies

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:45,280
some data from the database itself and insert it in one of the tables in the database.
