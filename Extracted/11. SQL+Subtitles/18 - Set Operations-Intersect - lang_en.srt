1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
Now, let's look at intersection in SQL.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,150
So, let's say we want to find all cities that are CurrentCity's for

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,210
someone and HomeTown's for someone,

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,980
not necessarily the same person and do not include duplicates.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,530
In SQL, that looks like this,

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,910
Select CurrentCity from RegularUser,

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,175
Select HomeTown from RegularUser,

8
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,460
intersects them while we turn a set.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,940
So, when you look here,

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,385
which cities are going to be CurrentCity for someone and HomeTown for someone,

11
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:31,055
not necessarily the same person,

12
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,365
while Seattle will not because not HomeTown for anyone.

13
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:40,035
Austin will because Austin appears here and it appears here and it appears here.

14
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:42,240
So, Austin is going to be part of the result.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,810
San Diego is not,.

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,440
San Francisco, yes, San Francisco is

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,620
here and San Francisco is here so it's part of the result.

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,210
College Park, no.

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,920
Austin is all ready included in the result.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,920
So a set returned as before.

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,780
If you want to see all cities as many times as they appear,

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,310
then you say Intersect All.

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,840
So, the only difference between the results here and

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,950
the results here now is that Austin is counted twice.

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,215
Why is that?

26
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:13,370
Well, as you see here,

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,650
Austin is the CurrentCity for two people and Austin is also the HomeTown for two people.

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,680
So, that is why Austin appears twice in the Intersect All.
