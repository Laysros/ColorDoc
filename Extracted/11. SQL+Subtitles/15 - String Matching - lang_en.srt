00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,790
Until now, most of the SQL questions we have looked at have

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,315
been just SQL versions of relational algebra queries.

3
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:10,285
There was one exception and that was distinct.

4
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:14,445
So, SQL databases are real practical tools.

5
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:17,370
They need to have capabilities that you have not

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,640
seen before in relational algebra and calculus.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,315
The second one of those is a string matching capability.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,115
So, consider a query like this;

9
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:29,250
find data about RegularUsers who live in a CurrentCity that

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,500
starts with San and is followed by something.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,265
Here's how you write that in SQL.

12
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:38,245
Select Email, Sex, CurrentCity from RegularUser,

13
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:42,300
where CurrentCity is like San % sign.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,440
So, % sign will match any string.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,230
That actually, includes the empty string.

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,680
So, San % sign is going to match San and

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,380
it's going to match San followed by anything of any length.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,990
So, let's take a look at that query.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,370
What is the result going to be?

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,710
So, it's on CurrentCity and we are going to return Email,

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,745
Sex and CurrentCity but only if the beginning of the CurrentCity matches San.

22
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:11,310
So, that's certainly not the case for Seattle.

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,780
It's certainly the case for San Diego,

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,870
starts with San, ends with Diego.

25
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,690
So, user3 with sex male,

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,615
and CurrentCity San Diego,

27
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,230
is part of the answer to the query.

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,370
User4 , San Francisco, same thing.

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,810
User6, San Diego, is part of the result.

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,025
Las Vegas, no.

31
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,470
College park, no.

32
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,730
There are more types of wildcards.

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,700
Don't confuse these wildcards with the style

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,520
wildcard we use in this select line to select all attributes.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,730
So, this one here matches the front and you can follow by % sign.

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,155
You could put that % in other places too.

37
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,995
Here's a somewhat different one.

38
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:55,160
This one says, select Email,

39
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,335
Sex, HomeTown from RegularUser,

40
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:01,860
where the HomeTown is like A followed by underscore,

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,900
underscore, underscore, underscore underscore.

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,180
Five underscores.

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,390
Each one of these underscores will match exactly one character.

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,020
So, we are in other words looking for RegularUsers that have

45
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,520
a HomeTowns that start with A and are followed by five additional characters.

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,710
So, is that the case with Atlanta?

47
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,090
No. It starts with A,

48
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,705
but then there are six additional characters.

49
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:28,130
Fourth and forget about it.

50
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,065
Atlanta, Atlanta, Atlanta.

51
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,620
Austin starts with A,

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,350
followed by 5 characters.

53
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:39,320
So, user12 who has HomeTown Austin qualifies in the result.
