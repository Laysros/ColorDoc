1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,765
Let's now look at update.

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:06,445
So, UPDATE UserInterests or right and SET Interest attribute to

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:12,650
rock music where the e-mail in that row is user three and the interest is music.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,185
This row here is the only one that satisfies the condition,

5
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:18,620
that its user three and the interest is music.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,680
So, this row here will be updated and the new value will be user3@gt.edu,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,585
rock music and 11.

8
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:31,720
Notice that a set update is possible in an update expression.
