1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,550
Let's now try a selection that actually has a WHERE clause.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,935
Let's say we want to find all RegularUser's with a Hometown equal Atlanta.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:10,210
Queries as follows, select everything,

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:15,995
in other words all the columns FROM RegularUser WHERE the Hometown equals Atlanta.

5
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:20,310
So from the RegularUser table WHERE is Hometown equal to Atlanta.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,270
So it is here for you user one,

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,105
so that row is part of the table,

8
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:25,800
it is for user four,

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,320
which will appear in the result and is for user six,

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,780
which is part of the result.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,690
What I'm trying to do in these examples and examples to follow is I'm trying to tie

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,965
my English text very close to the names used in relations,

13
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:45,400
in attributes, in columns etc.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,375
etc. So, when I write something like this "Find all RegularUsers with hometown Atlanta",

15
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,690
this is not of course correct English,

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm doing it because at the same time I want to point to

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,770
the RegularUser table so I had a choice between doing something like

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:09,350
this RegularUser's or just say find all RegularUser with Hometown Atlanta,

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,385
but that wouldn't sound right in English either.

20
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:13,880
So this is what I chose.
