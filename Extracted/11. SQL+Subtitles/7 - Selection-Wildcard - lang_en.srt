00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,855
Let's first look at a very simple selection query.

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,395
Let's say, we simply want to find all the rows in regular user.

3
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:10,205
Here's one way to write then.

4
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:13,215
SELECT Email, BirthYear, Sex,

5
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:16,440
CurrentCity, HomeTown FROM RegularUser.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,200
Notice there's no way I'm closing this query.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,400
Notice also, that all the SQL queries they end with a semicolon.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,560
So basically what we are saying here is give me all the attributes: email,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,710
birth year, sex, current city and hometown from the regular user table.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,600
And what is the result going to be?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,495
Well of course, it's going to be all the rows in the regular user table.

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,780
There's an easier way to write that by using the wildcard star.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,300
So, SELECT star actually is the exact same query as the one you see there.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,280
It makes it a little bit easier to type.
