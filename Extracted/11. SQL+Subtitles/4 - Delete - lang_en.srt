1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,515
Second, let's take a look at deletion.

2
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:05,845
So, this expression here will DELETE FROM UserInterests,

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:08,295
WHERE the Interest equals Swimming.

4
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:11,435
So, all the tuples that satisfy that condition,

5
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:14,800
this tuple here and this tuple here will be removed.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,270
So, the result is this.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:23,480
So, notice a deletion can actually result in deleting a set of rows in the table.
