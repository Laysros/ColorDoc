1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,085
Now, let's see how you would do an operation corresponding to an algebra Union in SQL.

2
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:10,690
Actually, now, we have gotten so used to algebra being involved in many SQL queries,

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,225
I'm not even gonna sound that alarm for you anymore.

4
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:17,955
So let's say you want to find all current cities in hometowns without duplicate.

5
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:19,200
How do we do that?

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,410
Well, we do one query that says select currency from regular user,

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,675
do another query that says select hometown from regular user,

8
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,555
and we say Union between them.

9
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:30,295
Does not get much simpler than that.

10
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:34,560
So basically, here, it's a projection on current city and from the same table,

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,805
it's a projection on home town and then it's the set Union of the two,

12
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,850
and notice in this case here that there are no duplicates.

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,850
So where as SQL queries in general may return duplicates?

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,610
The semantics of the Union intersection and

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,315
set difference operators is that sets are returned.

16
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:59,945
In case you do want to see cities as many times as they occur,

17
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:01,575
here is the way to do that.

18
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,135
Instead of saying Union,

19
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:07,230
as you do over there, you say Union All, same query.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,825
In this case, here in the Union All result,

21
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:11,720
you will get one, two, three,

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,015
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

23
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,325
10 rows in your result,

24
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:20,219
and that will of course include some duplicates like Atlanta,

25
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,950
just as hometown, is here three times.

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,695
So you're going to see Atlanta three times in this result.

27
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,560
Union All is what makes that [inaudible].
