1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
To continue talking about functionality,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,110
which is very useful in real life databases,

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,155
let's consider the concept of built-in functions.

4
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:12,130
So, count, sum, average, minimum,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,590
and maximum are all examples of built-in functions.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,005
Let's take a look at one.

7
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,085
Let's say, I want to count the number of RegularUser's.

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:23,885
In other words, count how many RegularUser's there are.

9
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:26,025
In SQL, that's written as follows,

10
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,915
SELECT count everything from RegularUser.

11
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:30,840
So, the semantics is as follows,

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,550
we've got user 1, 2, 3,

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,575
4, 6, 8 and 9.

14
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:36,410
That's a total of seven users.

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,275
So, the result here is a table with a single column,

16
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,665
and a single row,

17
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:49,020
and the number seven in it reflecting that there are seven rows in the RegularUser table.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,905
Let's look at a second example, max.

19
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:57,255
Let's say, we want to find Email and BirthYear for the youngest Female RegularUser.

20
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:58,530
It would look like this.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,730
Find Email and max(BirthYear) from RegularUser where Sex equals Female.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,295
So, let's take a look here at BirthYear and let's find out what the max(BirthYear) is.

23
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:17,180
See '85. '69? No. '67? No. '88 is younger than '85. '88, '68, '88.

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,430
So, turns out that there are three users that have birth year '88.

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,400
Two of those are females, user6 and user9.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
So, the result is user6 '88, user9 '88.
