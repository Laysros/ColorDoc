00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Sometimes tables are already indexed by the database management system.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,250
This is actually the case for the regular user the same way we have looked at.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,350
So, all the JOINs on that table and the look ups are on email.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,755
Email is the primary key of the table.

5
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:17,730
When you're using MySQL,

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,685
that table will actually already be clustered on or indexed on email.

7
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:25,965
Therefore, the issues we've been discussing for regular user

8
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:29,725
actually are non-issues when MySQL is used.

9
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:33,155
In some cases, database management systems support that,

10
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:34,665
in other case they do not.

11
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:38,170
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad.
