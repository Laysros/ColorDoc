1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
Now, addressing the issue that multiple access paths

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,910
really add up is done also by the RegularUser example.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,070
So, if you recall back to previous phases of the methodology,

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,920
there was a pending request from you for someone to be friends,

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,420
that accesses the RegularUser table.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,380
There was also a pending request to you that accesses the RegularUser table.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,760
Then, there is the View Profile test which is

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,890
just a retest and that accesses the RegularUser table.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,505
Then, of course, there was an Edit Profile test that updates the regular use information.

10
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,840
So, all of these different queries,

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,445
insertions, deletions to updates and so on,

12
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:43,590
they all affect RegularUser.

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,400
We need to know the frequencies of each one of these to see what

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,170
the weight of access on RegularUser is from an overall point of view,

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,240
and to help guide us as to whether we therefore need additional indexing of RegularUser.
