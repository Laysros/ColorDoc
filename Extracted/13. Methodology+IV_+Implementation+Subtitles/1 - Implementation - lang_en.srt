1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We are now ready to look at the last phase of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,105
the database application development methodology, implementation.

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:08,800
Let us review where we are.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,540
So, in design, we created a relational database schema and wrote the SQL for it.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,245
We also wrote the SQL for the tests that are going to access that relational schema.

6
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:23,325
We surrounded that SQL with abstract code.

7
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:25,300
In the implementation phase,

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,675
we are again going to do data first.

9
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:30,240
So, we start out with relational schema and we

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,085
need to implement that on relational platform.

11
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:36,230
We will install MySQL to run it on.

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,550
After we have done that,

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,740
we'll take a look at the abstract code that surrounds the SQL,

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,110
we will implement that in PHP and we will show how to

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,880
run that PHP script with the embedded SQL on the database we have set up.
