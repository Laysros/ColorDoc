00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
Now that I've shown you how to use BHB scripts on the web browser,

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,120
let us take a look what's inside a few of them now.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,105
I'll take you to the login.php page which was a first page on the application.

4
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:13,380
So here is the page.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,615
The first step in the php page is to connect to the database using three credentials.

6
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,420
The first is the host,

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,080
the host name should be correct.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,195
Next is the user and the password.

9
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,600
The user and the password is the same which we enter while

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,795
creating the database on the mamp or lamp stack.

11
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:36,675
Next we select the database GT online complete which is the database we are focusing on.

12
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,760
We need to enter the details of

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,730
the email ID and the password of the user as our first step.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,730
And since we're requesting data back from the web browser,

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,640
this is a post request which is mentioned in this php code.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,260
Also you'll notice that every step,

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,445
we have error statements to help you debug in case something goes wrong.

18
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:56,880
Next the page requests the user to enter the email and password.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,280
Once we have entered the email and password,

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,650
it gets stored in these two files.

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,890
Next, the query which runs in the background to retrieve the user,

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,165
the details of the user,

23
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,335
is the query as follows: select "Start" from user,

24
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:14,620
the email is that username that entered and password is the password that I can enter.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,585
Now once this query runs in the background,

26
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:18,540
it returns me a result set.

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,260
Next I check the number of rows in the result side is equal to zero.

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,785
That means I have not been returned any user from the web application.

29
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,680
That means the log in has failed or no such user exists.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,330
So if all such things go smoothly and I'm able to successfully log in,

31
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,780
the session starts and the session is what,

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,055
which will be active till the user logs out.

33
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:43,975
Next, I'm redirected to the profile.php page which is done by the header.

34
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:46,720
The rest part of the script includes HTML.

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,955
HTML is what we see in the front end of the application.

36
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:54,880
This HTML code uses the php script that I explain to you just know.
