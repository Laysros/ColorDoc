1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
As in all the previous phases,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,700
let's look at data first.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,465
Following this, you're going to see a number of WAMP stack demos.

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:11,150
In the first one, you're going to learn how to install a WAMP stack.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,225
Once the WAMP stack is installed,

6
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,395
it's ready to accept a database.

7
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:20,040
In general, database management systems come with bulk load utilities.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,995
These utilities make it easy to load

9
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:26,535
a lots database into a relational database management system.

10
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:29,490
We're going to cheat a little bit in this case because we

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,370
actually going to use a script to load

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:38,340
the example GTOnline database in through a tool called phpMyadmin.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,920
That script is going to be available to you on

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,190
the downloadable so you can use the same script

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,620
to create the GTOnline database

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,325
inside of the MySQL database that's part of your WAMP stack.

17
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:52,660
I strongly encourage you to play around with

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,560
the GTOnline database using the phpMyAdmin interface.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,610
It's a good way to familiarize yourselves better with SQL.

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,290
You can play with insertions,

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,535
you can play with queries,

22
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,525
and once you need to clean up the example database,

23
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:12,120
just go load it in using the script one more time.
