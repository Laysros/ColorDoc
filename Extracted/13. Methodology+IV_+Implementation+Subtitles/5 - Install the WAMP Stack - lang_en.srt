1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
So what we're basically here for is to install the WAMP stack,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,885
which is the tool that we're going to use for doing the projects in this class.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,470
There are essentially three different AMP stacks.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,710
There's the WAMP stack, which is good for Windows.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,810
There's the MAMP stack,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,000
which is for Macintosh and the LAMP stack which is good for Linux.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,630
The LAMP stack is actually the oldest as I understand it,

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,750
but we're going to work with the WAMP stack because we're on a Windows machine here.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,285
So these are the URLs that you will use.

10
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:28,520
I've tried all three of them.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,955
They all seem to work very well.

12
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:32,325
So you can use the one that's appropriate for you.

13
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,655
I will say, if you're using the WAMP stack on

14
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:37,440
Windows and you're on a machine that's still at XP,

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,225
it isn't going to work for you because I tried.

16
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:43,605
They don't support anything prior to Windows 7, I believe at this point.

17
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:48,000
So start with the URL that you want which in this case is this one.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,635
We're going to go over to the browser and we're going to go to that location.

19
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:56,255
The screen looks exactly the same whether you choose WAMP, LAMP or MAMP.

20
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,785
It's the same format so you'll see the same thing.

21
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:01,225
And what you'll do is over here, the latest version.

22
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:03,610
Just click on it. I'm sure you all know how to download things.

23
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,760
Click on "No thanks,

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,720
just take me to download" and save

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,945
the file or whatever's appropriate for your particular browser.

26
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,140
So here's the file that we have downloaded and we're just going to execute it.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,015
Go through the standard install.

28
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:16,860
Nothing special to achieve here.

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,930
Put it where you want to put it. You know how this works.

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,165
Now, this is the first thing that you need to be aware of.

31
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,295
It's going to create a root account for you.

32
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:26,595
The root account is what's going to have all of the access

33
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:30,045
to the database so you need to pick a password you're going to use.

34
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,225
Now try to begin installing.

35
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:37,680
Installation has completed and it will launch forth automatically when I click "Finish."
