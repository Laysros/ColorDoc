1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
We already looked at select,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,880
and we looked at select with the WHERE equals one.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,885
Now, if you want to go back,

4
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:10,060
and you can see there are two students with Los Angeles.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,225
So, if we were to say,

6
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:16,890
WHERE current city equals Los Angeles, and run.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,180
Now, we get just those two rows back.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,740
So, that pretty much covers it.

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,400
The basics of phpMyAdmin.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,930
There are some more tools in here,

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,850
but a lot of what we're going to want to do in

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,020
the class is going to be more script-based.

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,760
So, we're learning how to do things rather than doing them through the gooey.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,370
So, that you do it and good luck.
