00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190
So, let me now give you some general advice to summarize our discussion of these issues.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,755
First of all, pay attention to size.

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,820
Even for relatively small table,

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,450
you might not be able to keep it in memory at

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,330
all times and you might need to index it to get to [inaudible].

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,195
Multiple queries add up.

7
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:23,770
You need to consider all the different ways in which a particular table is accessed.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,175
In general, writes will suffer inefficiency when you index a table.

9
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,180
However, in most cases,

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,060
the write is preceded by a read,

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,470
which benefits from an index on the table.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,370
There are some neat tools that many database management systems come with.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,715
One valuable tool is a tool to measure performance.

14
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,985
Some database systems are able to print out for

15
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:48,325
you the actual query graph that's used to execute a query.

16
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:53,540
Very valuable to help you understand whether you need to further index that table or not,

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,490
to force the use of a better query graph.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,380
I recommend that you think globally but you act locally.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,470
So, make small changes and when you have made small changes,

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,170
compare the performance before the change to the performance after the change.

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,050
If you want to know in more details what you're doing,

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,300
you actually need to learn more about efficiency,

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,845
more about physical database organization,

24
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,570
and more about query optimization.
