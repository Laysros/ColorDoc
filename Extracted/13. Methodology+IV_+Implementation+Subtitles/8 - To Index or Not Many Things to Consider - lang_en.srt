1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
The last thing to consider in the data first portion of

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,700
the implementation phase is whether we need to index any tables or not.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,055
First, I'll show you how to compute the size of a table.

4
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:17,880
Second, a single table can be in the access paths of multiple queries and updates.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,170
Third, the relative frequencies or reads and

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,035
or writes will affect our decision of whether to index or not.

7
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:29,380
Next, it could be that the table is already appropriately indexed.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,310
Some database management systems like MySQL,

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,615
don't give you a choice.

10
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:36,305
Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's bad.

11
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:42,080
Finally, I'm going to give you some general advice of when to index and when not to.
