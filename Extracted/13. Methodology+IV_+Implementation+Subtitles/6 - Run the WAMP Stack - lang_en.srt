1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
There are two different things that you see when you run the WAMP stack.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,820
The first thing is it brings you to this main page

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,060
here but it also brings you this control panel.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,810
And the most important thing you're going to want here is

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,240
the managed servers because there are two things that will be running

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,240
on your machine and every once in a while you'll need to

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,500
stop them or start them or make sure if you reboot your machine,

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,250
"I don't know why one of the machines I

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,590
installed this on it comes up and automatically starts.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,450
The other one I installed it on when I was

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,760
playing comes up and doesn't automatically start," So you

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,650
have to start this up and then click "Start All"

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,970
and "My SQL" and the Web server will start.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,335
And then you can go over to here and say "Open my

15
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:43,480
phpMyAdmin" and this is where you need that password that we had before.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,185
So again we use GATECH.

17
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:52,200
You can use whatever you use and that brings us into the M"y phpAdmin" main screen.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,450
This is a web-based utility.

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,420
It's essentially if you have used any other databases,

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,935
if you've used PostgreSQL,

21
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:02,390
this is similar to the pgAdmin program.

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,020
If you've used Oracle,

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,675
it's similar to a number of different utilities that they have.

24
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:08,685
It basically shows us everything we have here.

25
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,380
So if I click on "Databases",

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,170
by default it has a few things that get loaded.

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,615
The next thing we're going to do is we are going to install

28
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:18,740
the sample database for the class that we are working on here.

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,485
We have this SQL script that we're going to use and I'm going to do it through.

30
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:25,410
You can run this at the command line but we're going to do it through the

31
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,770
gooey just to show you some of the usefulness of the gooey.

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,945
So basically, this is the script and I'm just going to cut it and

33
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:35,250
paste it into the query window for phpMyAdmin.

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,500
As you can see guys, I've posted this in here it has already formatted.

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,460
Apparently, it did that on this one.

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,970
When I did it on my computer,

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,440
it didn't automatically format.

38
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,110
You can press the Format button if it looks really funny and it

39
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,815
will become something more human-readable.

40
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:50,715
If you're not familiar with databases,

41
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,010
this will look like Greek to you.

42
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,080
By the time we're done, you'll understand what all this

43
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,190
is but it just creates table scripts and puts in

44
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,950
some initial rows and stuff so we're just going

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,970
to run that query and it's going to run and when it's done,

46
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,080
it tells us "That returned an empty result set."

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,770
The reason it says "I returned an empty result set," is we didn't do any queries.

48
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,800
There is DML and there's DDL.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,805
DML is data manipulation language.

50
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:15,015
DDL is data definition language.

51
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:16,760
That's things like creating tables,

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,300
inserting rows, that sort of thing.

53
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,385
This has all been DDL.

54
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:23,020
There's no result sets coming back because we haven't asked for anything.

55
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,520
But if we go back over here to the databases tab,

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,250
you will see that now our DDL online complete database exists and we

57
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,390
can click on it and go in and see all the tables that we have just created.

58
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,385
Let us choose user and we can click browse and we can see what's in there.

59
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:40,530
So this is basically just showing what's in

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,050
the table and we can do the same thing by going to

61
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,865
the SQL window and they've even showed us the query that they used.

62
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:49,580
I don't know why they have to wear one that's

63
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,420
not necessary but we could do the same thing

64
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,080
here and just type go and we get the same results back.

65
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,840
So now we're going to look at the regular user table and again we're going to

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,735
browse which shows us what's in that table.

67
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:05,910
It's got some different different columns in it and if we go to the structure tab,

68
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,660
we can actually see what the different columns are in the structure of the database.

69
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,745
So this one has the primary key.

70
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:14,865
This shows us the primary key is the email address which is

71
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:18,250
a very lengthy character up to 250 characters long.

72
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,125
So the collation field has something to do with which character set is supported.

73
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,970
This is non-nullable field.

74
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,990
To have a row in the table,

75
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,860
you must have something in this field as opposed to down here where it is nullable.

76
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,350
You can enter something and not put in a current city or a home town.

77
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,500
There is no default value for these three so again

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,680
you have to specify them when you add a row.

79
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,425
You don't have to specify these two because they have a default value defined.

80
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:46,335
So we could define a default value that says "Hello" as the default value and save that.

81
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:49,770
And now if we go back to the structure,

82
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,160
we can see that the default value for current city is hello.
