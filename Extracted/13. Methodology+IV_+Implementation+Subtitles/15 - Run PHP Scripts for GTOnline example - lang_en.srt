1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Let me show you how I can run PHP Scripts for some of

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,605
the tasks in the GT Online example that we have discussed in class.

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:10,420
By now, all of us should have either vamp,

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,070
mamp or lamp stack installed on our local machines.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,435
Let us first head to the php my admin page which contains

6
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:22,085
the GTOnline complete database with the tables installed a regular user,

7
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,600
user, and friendship which we'll be focusing on in this demo.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,190
Now to run PHP scripts,

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,575
we need to have a local host server running on our machines.

10
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:33,600
For that, I'll next head to the domain lan, the MacBook.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,640
For Windows users, you need to go to the command prompt and type run.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,945
The command to start the php local host server is php -S localhost: and port number.

13
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,305
The port number can be anything,

14
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:48,090
you just need to remember the port number that we have

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,010
entered and my local host server has

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,715
been started on the same folder which contains all my PHP Scripts.

17
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:56,505
So gtpe, underscore db,

18
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:59,120
underscore course is the same folder which contains

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,075
all the PHP scripts that I'm going to run in this demo.

20
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:05,070
Next, I head to the browser and I will first

21
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,475
show you the log in page which is the first page in the application.

22
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:09,755
To access the log in page,

23
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:12,585
you need to type localhost:8000.

24
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:14,735
The port number again should be the same port number that

25
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:17,890
we gave by starting the local host server;

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,825
/login.php and this takes me to the application login page.

27
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:24,300
Now I need to enter the login credentials of

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,090
a particular user to get into the application.

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,860
I'll head back to the php my admin page to pick up the details of one particular user.

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,905
I'll go to the user table and I'll select Michael Bluth for example.

31
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:38,840
I will just copy his email address and remember his password.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,590
Heading back to the log in page,

33
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,780
I entered the details which were already entered in the database and try logging in.

34
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,900
I've been successfully able to log into

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,530
the user page and I can currently view the profile of Michael Bluth.

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,550
Now the view profile is also another php page which is running in

37
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,235
the background that was accessed from the login.php page.

38
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:01,185
So next I can do a few tasks on this page like viewing the profile,

39
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:04,385
editing the profile, viewing the friends of the user, etc.

40
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:09,210
Let's try making a few changes to the already existing profile of Michael Bluth.

41
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,820
For that, I need to go to the edit profile page.

42
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,730
Let's quickly head back to the php my admin page and

43
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,155
verify the details that are currently existing on that log in page.

44
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:21,030
So it says the date of birth is 1st January,

45
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,700
1971 and the current city is New York.

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,550
So if I head back to the php my admin page and I go back to the regular user table,

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,130
I can find out that Michael Bluth's date of birth is 1st January,

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,905
1971 and his current city is New York.

49
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,755
So if I go back to the edit profile page and change

50
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:41,045
his current city from New York to San Francisco,

51
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,570
next I click "Save".

52
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,910
Next, let's see if these changes

53
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,455
that we've made have been reflected in the database or not.

54
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:51,020
If you go back to the php my admin page and refresh the page,

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,805
you can see that the user Michael Bluth,

56
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:56,840
his city, his current city has been updated to San Francisco.

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,875
Exactly what we did on the application.

58
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,875
Similarly, we can also view friends of

59
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:06,090
Michael Bluth and these are the same that I again listed on the database.
