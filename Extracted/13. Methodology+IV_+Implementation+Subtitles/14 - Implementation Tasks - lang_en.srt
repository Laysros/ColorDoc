00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Now that we have addressed data first in the implementation phase,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,715
let's take a look at the tasks.

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:09,540
Following this, you going to see demos that show you how to run

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,245
PHP scripts that implement a couple of the tasks in the DT online example.

5
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:17,245
The scripts for doing that, again,

6
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,360
are available on the downloadables.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,860
I strongly encourage you to check out the scripts to see how

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,310
the input and output documents are written in the script,

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,920
and how the scripts interact with the database.
