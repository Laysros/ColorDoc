00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,515
Let me first briefly give you an overview of all the AMP stacks that out there.

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:08,340
The basic idea is that all the client needs is a browser.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,610
That browser will talk with a server.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,770
On the server at the top level,

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,635
you have an HTML server,

6
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,130
underneath of that, you have a PHP server,

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,510
and finally at the bottom,

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,000
you have the database server.
