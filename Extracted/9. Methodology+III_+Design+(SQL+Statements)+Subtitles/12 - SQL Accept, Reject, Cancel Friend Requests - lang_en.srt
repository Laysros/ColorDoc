1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
If you decide to reject a request,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,075
then the road to look for is the one where friend's email is your email,

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:13,350
and the email is that of the person that requested you to become friends.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,530
So, delete from friendship where the email is

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,980
the value of friend's email and the friend email,

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,410
is your email is going to do the trick.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,345
Now, if you decide to accept a request,

8
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:26,715
and the time is now,

9
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:28,445
then this update will do it.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:33,360
You update the friendship table and you set date connected to now,

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,730
where the friend email is yours and the email is that of the requestor.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,880
Finally, if you decide to click cancel,

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,700
and cancel a request that you have made,

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,830
then the following SQL statement is going to delete the appropriate row.

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,240
Delete from friendship where the email equals your email as current user,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,040
and a friend email equals the value of the friend email identified on the form.
