1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
The attend and employment relations are both very complicated.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,105
They both stretch, both the capabilities of the relational model

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:13,755
and the extended entity relationship diagrams they were mapped from.

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:16,220
Let's talk about the attend relation.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:22,320
The attend relation is many to many relationship between regular user and school.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,610
So, it comes as no surprise that we need the identifiers for both,

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,550
to be combined, to identify a row in attend relation.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,080
However, adding to the complication,

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,200
we have a multi-value property type year graduated.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,900
And we know that the way that it is modeled

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,710
is that the thing it is about has a key which is

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,400
combined with the multi-valued attribute in order to

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,690
identify each individual value for this particular combination.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,815
We, therefore, need an identifier here that consists of three elements.

15
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:59,220
However, the customer requirements that we are working

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,550
from allows year graduated to be left blank,

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,140
because no portion of a primary key is allowed to be null.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,085
It is not possible to use primary key in the table definition.

19
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:13,620
So I'm using unique instead.

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,320
So this relation here is going to have email is a varchar (50),

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,920
school name varchar (50).

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,460
None of those will be null because then we would not

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,340
know which relation we are talking about.

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,740
Year graduated is an integer which initially is set to null,

25
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,670
the intent being that a value can later be

26
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,955
added when the person has graduated from the school.

27
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:40,260
We use unique instead of primary key to include all of all three.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,100
Obviously, both email and school name are foreign keys on

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,615
the relations that contain the existence of the corresponding entity.

30
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:52,520
Even this way to model things could get us in trouble.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,920
For example, if a particular person is working,

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,255
or two educations at the same time in the same institution,

33
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:05,010
like both are bachelors and a masters in the same university at the same time,

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,480
then year graduated will be null in both cases.
