1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
So, we have now completed the data first portion of

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,530
the design phase of the database application development methodology.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,460
We took the extended interrelationship diagram,

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,295
used the mapping to generate a set of relations.

5
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:18,510
We check that the relations are in the proper Boyce-Codd normal form.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,720
Now, the next step is to take a look at the tasks

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,035
that we specified in the specification process.

8
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,350
Those tasks express what tests of the application will

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,860
do relative to the extended interrelationship diagram.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,550
Now, that we have translated that diagram into a set of relations,

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,060
we need to adjust the task to do to

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,770
the relations what they previously did to the extended interrelationship diagram.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,380
So, in the abstract code for the task,

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,230
we need the code to work on the relational schema

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,380
as opposed to the extended interrelationship diagram.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,440
So, let's now dive into that step of the design phase.
