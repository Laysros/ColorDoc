1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,105
Let's first look at the View Profile text,

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:07,140
and concentrate on the subtext that retrieves the personal information.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,520
So, in other words,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,110
we are looking at how to retrieve first name,

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,780
last name, rest of

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,190
these personal information items to display on the View Profile screen.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,105
We are making the assumption that the email of

8
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:22,930
the current user is managed by the application.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,770
So, we are going to retrieve first name, last name, sex,

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,485
birth date, current city,

11
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:32,280
and hometown for the particular user in question.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,125
We do that as follows: here's your SELECT, FROM, WHERE statement.

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,670
So, we select first name and last name,

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,920
birth date, sex, current city,

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,055
and hometown from the user table which contains the first name and the last name.

16
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:52,780
INNER JOIN RegularUser, which of course contains the birth date,

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,630
sex, current city, and hometown.

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,190
The INNER JOIN condition is that

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,864
user email which the application remembers is equal to RegularUser.Email,

20
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:08,090
and that email is the one that the application remembers.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,785
That leaves us with the multi-valued attribute interests,

22
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:15,420
and we simply find that with select from interests

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,345
where the email matches the one that the application remembers.

24
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,560
We display those on the form.
