1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
The next step of the design phase,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,315
is to now take this graphical representation of the relations that resulted from mapping,

3
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:09,510
the extended into relationship diagram,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,285
together with a format specifications that we created earlier and combined those two,

5
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:20,425
in create table statements that actually define these relations in SQL.

6
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:24,180
Here's the create table statement for the first one of the relations.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,590
The user relation, the email is a varchar (50),

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,975
it is not allowed to be null. Why not?

9
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,270
Because you are going to participate in the primary key.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,835
Then we have, first name,

11
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:39,480
last name and password these are all varchar (50)s. They are also not allowed to

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,240
be null but that's because we insist on collecting all that information from every user.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,345
The primary key of this relation is email.

14
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:51,330
The SQL syntax for this is simply as stated.

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,030
Notice that these statements end in a semi colon.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,405
So, this is the SQL that will set up this structure,

17
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:01,020
with a data format specified inside the database.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,260
Now let's look at the regular user table,

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,800
it has five attributes;

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,305
email, birth date, sex,

21
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:07,650
currency and home hometown,

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,930
email is a varchar (50),

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,115
it can't be null,

24
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,840
because I intend to set it to be the primary key.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,175
The property type sex is a single character initially set to null,

26
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,425
birth date is order type,

27
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:23,435
date time and initially set to the value null,

28
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:25,030
current city and hometown,

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,415
are varchar (50)s also set to null.

30
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:30,765
Primary key is email and notice the email of

31
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:35,460
the regular user of course is a foreign key on email of user.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,555
So, foreign key email references the email in the user table,

33
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:42,910
direct modeling this relationship.

34
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,530
The admin user relation is very simple,

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,375
email is the primary key,

36
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,850
lastlogin is the only attribute initially set to null.

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,370
The primary key is also a foreign key pointing to email in the user table.

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:02,550
So, email in admin user is a foreign key and it references email in the user table.

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,785
Finally, the interest table has two attributes email and interests.

40
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:10,330
The primary key consists of both,

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,065
so none of them can be null.

42
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:18,165
Email in addition is a foreign key that points to the email of regular user.

43
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,690
Why not to the email of user?

44
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,810
Well, the reason is,

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,375
that it's only the regular users that actually have interests,

46
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,400
admin users do not.
