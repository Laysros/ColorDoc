00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
Let's finally look at how to add and delete employers for particular regular user.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,970
On the screen, we will have identified

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,325
the EmployerName and JobTitle that need to be deleted.

4
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:14,865
The following SQL statement will do the deletion.

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:18,870
Delete from employment where the Email matches that of

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,415
the current user and the EmployerName is

7
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:24,730
that on the screen and the JobTitle is that on the screen.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,660
If we are adding a new job where the value of

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,250
the EmployerName and JobTitle are given in the text fields on the screen,

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,065
then the following statement will do that addition of the job.

11
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:40,690
Insert into Employment, Email, EmployerName, and JobTitle,

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,690
where the values are the Email of the current user,

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,175
the EmployerName written in the text box,

14
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,720
and the JobTitle written in the text box.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,590
To update an existing job,

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,020
we will assume that the application manages OldEmployerName and OldJobTitle.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,900
The following update employment statement will

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,350
replace the old values by the two new values.

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,980
So, update employment, set EmployerName to the new one,

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,135
set JobTitle to the new one,

21
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,625
where the Email is that of the current user,

22
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:15,035
and the EmployerName currently is the OldEmployerName,

23
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:18,580
and the JobTitle currently the OldJobTitle.
