1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
If the user clicks "Delete this School," then we delete

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,275
from Attend where the email matches the email of the current user.

3
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:12,280
The school name matches the school name identified to be deleted,

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,700
and the year graduated matches the year

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,480
graduated of the school that has been identified to be deleted.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,820
If a new school is added with a school name given here and a year graduated given

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,375
here that will be done by an insertion into the Attend's table of email,

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,350
school name, and year graduated,

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,650
where the values are the email of the current user,

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,630
the school name read from input,

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,085
and the year graduated read from input.

12
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:41,190
To update an existing school,

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,830
we need to make the assumption that the application

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,450
manages the old school name and the old year graduated.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,905
To overwrite those with the new values of school name and year graduated,

16
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:53,730
we need an update statement.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,845
Update Attends will set the school name to

18
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:01,680
the new value and the year graduated to the new value where the following is true,

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,420
namely the email equals the email of the current user,

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,210
the school name is the old name,

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,320
and the year graduated is the old year.
