1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Let us now look at the second subtext of the View Profile text,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,825
namely the subtext education.

3
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:10,335
In that subtext, we extract school name,

4
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:12,680
school type, and year graduated.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,120
As you see, school name and type are in the school table;

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,080
year graduated is in the attend table.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,590
So, we need to proceed as follows.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,080
We take the score table and join it with the attend table on matching

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,390
school names and then we extract where the email is the email of the current user.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,425
So, let's look at the SQL for that.

11
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:38,190
We select School.SchoolName and School.Type and

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,990
we select Attend.YearGraduated and we do it by

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,560
taking the attend table and doing an INNER JOIN with

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,945
schoool and the join condition is that the two school names match.

15
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,200
School name must match school name,

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,165
and we extract where the email matches that of the current user.

17
00:00:57,165 --> 00:01:01,260
Finally, extracting the professional information consisting of

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,100
employer name and job title is done from the employment table.

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,070
So, we select employer name and job title from employment

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,240
where the email is that of the current user and we display that information here.
