1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's look at how requesting a friendship is

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,580
done through an insertion into the friendship table.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,530
As before, we assume that the application knows the e-mail of the current user.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,850
It will also know the e-mail of the friend that's

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,285
being requested through a user click on the screen,

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:24,025
and the relationship will be input by the user that's making the request.

7
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,225
With that information, this is the insertion.

8
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,885
So, insert into the friendship table,

9
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:32,030
and e-mail, a friends e-mail,

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,370
and date connected and a relationship.

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,005
The values the following;

12
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:37,880
the e-mail of the current user,

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,340
the friend email identified there,

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,700
the null value for date connected,

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,760
because this invitation has not yet been accepted,

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,350
and then the value of relationship read from the screen.
