1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,065
Let's look at the subtask view pending requests.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:06,410
There are two kinds of pending requests;

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,440
pending requests to you and pending requests from you.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,055
Let's concentrate on pending requests to you first.

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,525
When it's a pending request to you,

6
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,710
you know that in the friendship table,

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,780
the friend email in this case, is your email.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,540
The one requesting you to become friends has this email.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,245
To collect the information about the requestor,

10
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:35,090
you need a three-way join that puts together the first name,

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,440
last name, birthday, sex etc.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,880
to the email of the person that requests you to become friends.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,070
This three-way join is illustrated here.

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,805
So, you join friendship,

15
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:52,070
RegularUser and user and it's all on matching emails.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,170
That email matches this one, matches this one.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,100
Now, you got one big table with all this information in it.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,140
Their particular row you want to extract in that table is the row

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,360
where their friends email is your email as current user,

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,320
and date connected is null because it's still pending.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,575
So, now you've got that one row.

22
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:20,585
From that you can now extract from the requester the email,

23
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:25,125
the first name, the last name, hometown, relationship etc.

24
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,655
When the request is from you,

25
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:28,980
you know the following,

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,180
the email in the friendship table is your email.

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,120
To pull together all the information about

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,040
the other user you have requested to be friends with,

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,190
you need to match the user email,

30
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,330
the regular user email to the friends email,

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,880
and that is exactly what is done in this three-way join here.
