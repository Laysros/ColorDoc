1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,795
We have now completed the first half of the design phase.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:07,350
We started out with an extended entity relationship diagram

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,875
and some data format specifications,

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,730
and we use the mapping from

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,190
the extended entity relationship model to

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,940
the relational model to create a set of table definitions.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,690
So, now we have completed our relational schema definition.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,650
We now turn our attention to the tasks.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,740
In the specification, the test stated what the application case

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,875
needs to do relative to the extended entity relationship diagram.

11
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:37,950
In the design, we now need to replace the code that states what

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,000
the application does to the database with SQL statements that realize that.
