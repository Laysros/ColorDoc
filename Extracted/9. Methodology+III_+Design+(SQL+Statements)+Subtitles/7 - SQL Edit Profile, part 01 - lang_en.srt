1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,970
The Edit Profile task has four sub tasks.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,380
View Profile, which we just completed,

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,095
Update Personal Information, Add or Delete a School,

4
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,195
Add or Delete an Employer.

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:15,680
The first step is to populate the dropdowns namely,

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,785
School Name and Employer Name.

7
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:20,705
So, those dropdowns here, to populate those,

8
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:23,730
we need to do a selection from the set of

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,345
school names and a set of employer names that currently exist.

10
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:30,690
So, each one of the SQL statements for that are here.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,735
SELECT SchoolName and Type FROM School,

12
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,235
SELECT EmployerName FROM Employer.

13
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:40,050
Now to update the personal information,

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,015
we continue to assume that the email of the current user is managed by the application.

15
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,675
We then read Sex, Birthdate,

16
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:51,055
CurrentCity and Hometown from the input fields

17
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:54,765
on the personal information portion of the Profile screen.

18
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,490
So, having read those,

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,500
we now update the RegularUser and we overwrite the Sex with a new value,

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,110
the Birthdate with a new value,

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,125
CurrentCity, and Hometown with a new value and we do it for the row

22
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:11,725
that has an Email address that matches the Email of the current user.

23
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,440
For each one of the Interest that's added,

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:21,040
we insert into the Interest table the Email of the current user, and the interest.
