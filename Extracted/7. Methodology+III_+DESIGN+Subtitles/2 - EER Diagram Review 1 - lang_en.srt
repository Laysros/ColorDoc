00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,435
So, here's the extended entity relationship diagram we ended up with.

2
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:08,010
Just in review, we have a set of users.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,190
Users are uniquely identified by their Email,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,500
and in addition to that property type,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,240
it has property type of Password and Name

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,370
which is composite consisting of First and LastName.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,840
Users have two subsets: RegularUsers and AdminUsers.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,885
The two subsets are disjoint.

9
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:29,000
In other words, extensions often cannot overlap.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,155
Each one of these subsets of course will inherit the properties of the supertype,

11
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:36,480
so RegularUser will inherit Email,

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,735
Password, and Name, and so will AdminUser.

13
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:43,245
AdminUser in addition has a property type LastLogin

14
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:47,225
whereas RegularUser has a number of property types: Sex,

15
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,325
Birthdate, CurrentCity, and HomeTown,

16
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:52,120
and then a multi-valued property type Interests.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,045
RegularUsers also are connected to the many Schools that may have attended,

18
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:00,090
and each one of these Schools will have a SchoolType.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,335
RegularUsers also have worked for a number of Employers.

20
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:07,405
They may have worked for the same Employer several times,

21
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:09,460
each time with a different JobTitle.

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,710
Employers are uniquely identified by the EmployerName,

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,350
as Schools are uniquely identified by SchoolName.

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,775
Friendships may be requested and may be accepted.

25
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:24,290
So, a RegularUser can request a Friendship with an other RegularUser.

26
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,155
That other RegularUser in turn may accept that Friendship.

27
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,760
For a particular RegularUser, of course,

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,040
they will be a set of Friendships that that RegularUser has requested along

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
with a set of Friendship that that RegularUser has accepted to enter into.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,670
So, our job now is to take

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,655
this extended entity relationship diagram and translate it into a relational database.

32
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,640
We will do that a little step at a time.
