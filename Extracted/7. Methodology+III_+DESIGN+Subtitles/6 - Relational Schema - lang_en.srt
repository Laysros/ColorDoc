00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,295
So here's a summary of the whole thing.

2
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:07,035
This is the schema we have mapped and this is a summary of what I showed you before.

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:09,870
So our relational schema is now this one,

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,070
represented in graphical form with all the primary keys,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,330
all the keys, and all the foreign key relationship types.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,560
It is important that each one of these relations is in the proper normal form.
