1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's first concentrate on the mapping of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,660
the super sub type relationship that connects users to regular users and admin users.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,190
There were a couple of options in the mapping,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,595
we have chosen the option where we create a relation for each one of the entity types.

5
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:18,760
So, for the first entity type user,

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,140
we create the relation user it has identifying

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,150
property type email and that therefore becomes the primary key of the user relation.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,120
In addition, it has property types password

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,585
and it has property types first name and last name.

10
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:35,670
Unfortunately as you recall,

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,635
composite property types are not preserved in the mapping.

12
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:41,605
User has two sub types;

13
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,620
regular user and admin user,

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,165
both of those will inherit email password,

15
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:49,115
first name and last name.

16
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,720
However, in the mapping of each one of

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,250
these entity types the only one of these that will appear is

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,570
the identifying property type email which will become the primary key

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,485
in the admin user relation and in the regular user relation.

20
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,545
In the admin user relation,

21
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:10,500
we have in addition the last log in and in

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,850
the regular user relation we have an additional four properties namely;

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,170
sex, birth date, current city and hometown as reflected here.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,320
As you recall, multi value property types,

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,425
each one of those,

26
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:25,860
will get its separate relation together with

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,140
the identifying property type for that entity type.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,705
So, for the interest property type a separate relation will be generated and that

29
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:38,535
relation will have the combination of email and interest as primary key.

30
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:42,810
You see here that email of admin user in addition to

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,160
being primary key also is a foreign key pointing back to the user relation.

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,335
In other words, it's not possible to have an admin user who is not also a user.

33
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:54,780
Similarly for the regular users,

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,750
the email primary key of regular user

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,290
is also a foreign key pointing back to email end user.

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,360
Finally, interests are properties of regular users,

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,600
therefore email which is part of the primary key of interest,

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,910
email will be a foreign key pointing back to email of the regular user.
