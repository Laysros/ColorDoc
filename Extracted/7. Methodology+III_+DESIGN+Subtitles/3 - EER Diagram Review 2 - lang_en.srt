00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
Now, let us concentrate on mapping the portion of the entity relationship diagram that

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,250
tie regular users to the schools they attended

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,295
and to the employers that they were employed by.

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:13,170
Let us start here at the bottom.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,155
The entity type, SchoolType,

6
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:20,280
results in a relation with a single property type namely TypeName,

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,660
which is the identifying property type of that relation.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,115
So, therefore, TypeName in essence will have values

9
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:31,190
that is just a listing of the different kinds of types like high school,

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,515
middle school, elementary school, etc.

11
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:38,065
The School entity type has identified property type SchoolName.

12
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:39,590
For that entity type,

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,075
there'll be a relation school,

14
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,020
it has SchoolName as a property type,

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,520
it's the primary key,

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,110
and then it has type as an additional property because it is

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,145
the many site of a one to many relationship that many site can point to the SchoolType.

18
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,510
So, the type you see here is basically

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,800
a foreign key pointing to the primary key of school type.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,295
The attend relationship type is many-to-many relationship type as you can see.

21
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:09,260
In order to map many-to-many relationship types,

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,260
we need the identifying property type of each one of the participating entity types.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,040
So, we need Email to identify RegularUser and we need SchoolName to identify the School.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,985
So, therefore, it's no surprise that for the attend many-to-many relationship type,

25
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,725
we will have both the Email and the SchoolName included.

26
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,480
What is a little bit different about

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,670
this mapping is that for each one of these instances,

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,195
there is a YearGraduated associated with it.

29
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:41,160
One reason for that could be that you might attend, for example,

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,620
Georgia Tech twice, once for your bachelor's and one for your master's.

31
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,540
For each one of those, there will,

32
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,025
of course, be a unique YearGraduated.

33
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,600
How do we model a multivalue like this?

34
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,700
Well, it's a multivalue of that relationship type,

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,650
so we would need the identifier for the relationship type,

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,065
which is a combination of these two.

37
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:04,200
We can collapse that mapping all-in-all into

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,260
a single relation call Attend that has both the School identifier of SchooName,

39
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,380
the RegularUser identifier of Email,

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,375
and then YearGraduated, all of those combined as unique.

41
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:19,915
The employment relationship type is also a many-to-many relationship type,

42
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:22,465
so it will result in a relation called

43
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:26,340
employment that will have the Email of the RegularUser employed,

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,630
the EmployerName of the Employer,

45
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,475
and as before, an attribute for the JobTitle, which is multivalue.

46
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:37,605
So, this is very similar in nature to the relation we just generated here.

47
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,910
So, Employment will have Email,

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,740
EmployerName, and JobTitle as unique.

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,925
Noticed that for this unique or for this key,

50
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:49,865
SchoolName is a foreign key on SchoolName of School.

51
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,350
For this unique key,

52
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,530
EmployerName is a foreign key pointing to

53
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,975
the primary key EmployerName for the employer relation.

54
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:01,350
Notice that I have indicated the RegularUser table here,

55
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,400
although we have previously dealt with that.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,160
The reason is that the RegularUser who

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,300
participates in the Attend relationship and the Employment relationship,

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,660
those are users who have emails that of course,

59
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,405
appear in the RegularUser Email list.

60
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,945
So, therefore, Email of Attend and

61
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:23,680
Email of Employment are foreign keys on Email in RegularUser.
