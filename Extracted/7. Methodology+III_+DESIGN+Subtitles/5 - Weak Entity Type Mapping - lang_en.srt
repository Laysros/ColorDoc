1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,235
Finally, let's look at the mapping of the week entity type friendship.

2
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:06,695
This is a fairly complex situation.

3
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:09,800
So you have a strong entity type regular user and

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,170
a weak entity type friendship and there's

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,360
an identification relationship type between them.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,565
So in other words in order to identify

7
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:21,050
friendship you're going to need the identifier for regular user.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,900
But wait, there's one more of those involved.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,020
So in order to understand a friendship you need to know

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,990
not just the regular user that requested it but

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,230
also the regular user who has been asked to accept it.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,170
So when looking at the friendship relationship type it will have email twice.

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,875
It will have email of the one making the request and

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,890
email of the friend that the request is being made to.

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,430
Then there are two property types relationship and

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,420
date connected and date connected is going to initially be

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,380
null and then subsequently if the one invited to become

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,940
friends accepts it will be set to the date of that accept.

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,895
Again I've included this one in order to show that

20
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:08,990
both the email of the requester and the potential acceptor of

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,745
the friendship is going to be an email of

22
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:16,865
a regular user since only regular users can participate in these friendships.

23
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:21,400
An interesting aside about this friendship relation is the following.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,700
Notice that there are two one to many relationships into friendship and typically when we

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,150
have a many to many relationship type that can actually be

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,165
modeled by two one to many relationships into the same entity type.

27
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,625
When that's the case,

28
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,330
then the combination is a key.

29
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,820
That corresponds very much to other cases we've seen of many to

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,400
many relationship types where you take a key from each end of the relationship.
