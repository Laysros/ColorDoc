1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
As a result of the specification phase of

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,855
the database application development methodology,

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:09,225
we generated an extended entity-relationship diagram

4
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:12,840
together with a set of test decompositions and

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,470
associated abstract code specifying what the test would

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,250
do relative to the extended entity-relationship diagram.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,295
Our next phase of the methodology is the design phase.

8
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:25,560
In the design phase,

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,860
we first concentrate on data and take

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,195
the extended entity-relationship diagram and translate that into a relational schema.

11
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:36,570
We then take the abstract code for the tasks and

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,345
translate that into abstract code with embedded SQL

13
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:44,040
that will do to the relational schema what the tests was

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,130
specified to do through the extended entity-relationship diagram.

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,885
In order to understand that first step of the design phase,

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:57,300
we have taken a detour to find out enough about relations and enough about

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,205
the mapping of the extended entity-relationship model

18
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:04,000
to relations that we'd be able to carry out that step.
