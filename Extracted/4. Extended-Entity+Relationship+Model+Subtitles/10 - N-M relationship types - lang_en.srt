1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,790
The next relationship type we'll look
at is a many to many relationship type,

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,590
or an N to M relationship type.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,560
You can see it's a many to many
relationship type when the cardinalities

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,140
here are described on
the lines of the relationship.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,230
So this is a many to many relationship
type between regular users and

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,070
the schools they attended.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,840
Again, let's take a look
at the instance diagram.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,450
So here we have five
regular users shown.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,978
Here we have a a bunch of schools shown.

10
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:33,580
The relationships here demonstrate
that this regular user here has

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,685
attended these four schools.

12
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38,020
This regular user, this one school.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,210
This regular user here, these schools.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,156
But see what happens now when we're
dealing with many to many relationship

15
00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:45,720
types.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,548
So notice now that one element here,
this regular user here may have

17
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:55,038
attended these four schools, but
notice that this school here

18
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:59,713
actually has three regular users
who have attended that school.

19
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:04,159
So in other words, any single element
here may be mapped to multiple

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,683
elements over here, and any single
element over here may be mapped to

21
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:12,126
multiple elements on the left
side as is shown here.

22
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,463
No longer do we have a function here.

23
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:18,060
This is a relationship in
the mathematical sense of the word.
