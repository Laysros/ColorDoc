00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,240
There are three kinds of abstractions
that people normally agree are important

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,890
when you try to fix
a perception of reality.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:12,400
They are classification,
aggregation, and generalization.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,270
Our ability to define, for

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,010
example, entity types in
the Extended Entity Relationship model,

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,310
clearly is in support of
representing classification.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,650
The super subtype
relationship is introduced

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,310
in order to be able to
support generalization.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,460
But how about aggregation?

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,070
Does the Empty Relationship Model
really support that?
