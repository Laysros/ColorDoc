00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,070
The extended entity relationship
model is great for fixing and

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,900
representing a perception of reality.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,900
However, there is no commercial
database system that implements

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,740
the model directly.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,440
Almost all the commercial systems
implement a relational data model.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,130
So what I want to do is
to show you how to map

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,660
extended entity relationship
diagrams to relations.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,524
For you to understand that mapping,
I first need to define for

9
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:29,021
you what a relation is.
