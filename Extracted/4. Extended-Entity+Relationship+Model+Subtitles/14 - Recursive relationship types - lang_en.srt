1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,810
What you see here is
a recursive relationship type.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,140
It's called recursive because it
relates an entity type to itself.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,980
So you have the AdminUser
entity type here with

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,240
properties Email which is identifying
and then a SinceDate property,

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,440
a SinceDate When that adminUser became

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,510
the supervisor for
another adminuser who is the supervisee.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,290
As you see here, a couple of extra
things are added to our notation.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,540
First of all, there's a direction
to the lines of the relationship.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,980
Second we add roles to
the relationship sides.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,960
Why do we do that?

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,810
We do that because when we have
one instance of an admin user,

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,550
we need to know whether that admin
user plays the role of supervisor or

13
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,930
supervisee in the manages relationship.

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,620
So let us illustrate that
with an instance diagram.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,360
So take a look at these seven
instances of admin users and

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,820
let's see how they are related
to each other in this hierarchy.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,140
So what you see in this hierarchy
is that this admin user instance

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,280
is the supervisor and manages this admin

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,560
user who is the supervisee then,
apparently, of that admin user.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,930
This admin user is the supervisor
of this one and he or

21
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,130
she is the supervisor of this one.

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,170
And at this node,

23
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,870
supervisee of this supervisor Is
this person and here's another one.

24
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,830
The person here is the supervisee
of that supervisor.

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,810
So this is the manager's hierarchy

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,950
that you see among the admin
users in this example.
