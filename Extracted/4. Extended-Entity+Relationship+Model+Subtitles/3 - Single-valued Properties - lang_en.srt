1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,540
Second we are going to
talk about property types.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,300
Property types
are represented by ellipses.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,550
These ellipses carry names.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,400
So for the user entity type we just

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,900
introduced I have here shown you
two single valued properties.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,940
The fact that this is a single line

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,470
ellipsis signifies that it
is a single valued property.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,490
The first property here has the name,

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,720
Email, second property here
has the name, Password.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,110
So let us look at the instance diagram.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,370
So here you see there
are three instances of user.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,710
And the first user is Leo and
that user has the password qwerty.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,220
The second user is Rocky,
has the password Lydia.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,138
And the last user is Jim who
has the password Fido123.

15
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:52,730
So what are property values?

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,440
They can take many forms.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,330
They can be lexical,
as you can see here,

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,210
we've used letters to represent them.

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,820
They could be any other form
of visible element, I mean,

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,540
it could be a picture of a user.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,594
They could be audible.

22
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:14,930
In other words, you can say what they
are without writing them down, without

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,790
showing a picture, but it's just the
audible, the sound of it that's used.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,880
It's interesting to see that,
whereas the instances of user

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,980
are just surrogates, just representing
user, when you look at values,

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,300
for example, of Email,
not only is it a thing in and

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,210
by itself, but it's actually
a thing that names something.

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,030
In this case,
it actually names the password.
