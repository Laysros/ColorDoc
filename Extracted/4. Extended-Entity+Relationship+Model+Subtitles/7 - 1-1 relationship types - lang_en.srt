1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,980
We've now seen the concept of an entity
type, and we've several different

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,030
property types, let's now turn our
attention to relationship types.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,330
Relationship types
are represent by diamonds.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,027
So here in this example, we have
two entity of types, male user and

5
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:21,330
female user, and they are connected by
the relationship type, current marriage.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,790
This notation here is
the carnality of that relationship.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:33,550
It says that this relationship, current
marriage, is a 1-1 relationship type.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,440
Let's add the instance diagram
to see what that means.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,690
So here we have four instances of
maleuser and we have six femaleuser.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,940
As you can see, this maleuser here is
currently married to this femaleuser.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,410
This user here may be
married to this femaleuser.

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,099
And this user here is currently
married to this femaleuser.

13
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:02,745
Notice that there are a couple of
maleusers here that are currently not

14
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:03,462
married.

15
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:09,598
And notice there are three femaleusers
here that are currently not married.

16
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:12,390
So since there are instances
of maleuser and

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,490
instances of femaleuser that are not
married, this function here or

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,680
this mapping between these two
entity types is a partial function.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,050
Why is it a function?

20
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,910
It's a function because for
each one of the elements here,

21
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,250
there's at most one element
over here that it's mapped to.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,040
It's partial because there are some
that are not mapped to anything.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,160
If we were to have two relationship
types between the same two entity types

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,330
then they would clearly have
to have different names so

25
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,970
we can distinguish between them.
