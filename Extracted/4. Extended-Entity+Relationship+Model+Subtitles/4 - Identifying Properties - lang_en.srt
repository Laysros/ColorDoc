1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,280
Some property types
are identifying property types.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,580
That's shown by underlining
the name of the property type.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,330
Let's look at what that means
in the instance diagram.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,149
So here you have again a user
with a name leo@gt.edu.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,970
Got another user Rocky,
you got a third user Jim.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,270
The constraint that email
be an identifying property

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,420
has the following implication.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,150
When you point to a particular value,
like leo@gt.edu,

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:40,220
there can be only a single entity
instance identified by that email value.

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,140
So what would not be possible is
that given a value of email here,

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,780
that this would point to two
different instances of user.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,910
So that's not possible.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,850
It is important to understand that
every single entity instance in

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,780
the database at any given point in
time must be uniquely reference-able.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,020
It was very easy and

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,410
very simple to see in this case here
where you just have one identifying

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,900
property type that is used to uniquely
identify the identity instances.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,210
Later on we going to see cases
where multiple property types and

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,190
even in some situations
relationship types are needed

20
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,440
in order to uniquely reference
instances of entities.
