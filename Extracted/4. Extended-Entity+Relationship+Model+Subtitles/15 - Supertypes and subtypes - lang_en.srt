1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,685
Let us look at super subtypes or

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:06,150
is-a relationship types
as they are also called.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,320
Here we have the entity type of user and

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,940
we have two subtypes of user,
regular user and admin user.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,780
A RegularUser is a User and
an AdminUser is a User.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,480
We also have Female users and
a Female User is a User and

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,030
a Male User is a User.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,610
Let's look at the instance diagram
to understand the semantics

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,810
of this relationship type.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,150
So here we have two instances of Male
Users, three instances of Female Users.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,240
As you can see,
everyone of the Male Users and

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,910
everyone of the Female Users
is also a User.

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,560
In other words there are no
instances of Male and

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,960
Female Users that are not also a User.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,630
None of these users are both in the set
of Female Users and Male Users.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,130
Why is that the case?

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,390
That's because we have insisted on
enforcing a disjointness constraint.

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,320
And that means that the two
subtypes cannot overlap.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,700
Now let's look at the instances in the
Subtype of RegularUser and AdminUser.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,180
Again you see that you
cannot have a user

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,770
who's a regular user
without also being a user.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,330
So every single one of
these also appear up here.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,460
Neither can you have an AdminUser who
does not appear as a User up here.

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,070
But notice that it is actually
possible to have a user

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,980
who is both a RegularUser and
an AdminUser reflecting

26
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,640
that this constraint here allows
that the two subtypes overlap.
