1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,930
So in this example, what I've done,
is I revised the single relationship

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,030
type we had here to basically three
different binary relationship types.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,220
So here, you see Regular User,

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,750
while the User Team relationship
is hooked up to Team.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,670
Team is hooked up to
Event by Team Event, and

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,200
Event is hooked up to
Regular User by User Event.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,070
What would the meaning of
these relationships be?

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,380
Well, this one would merely state that
a regular user is on a particular team.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,110
It would state that regular user
participates in some event.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,000
It would state that in some event,
particular teams are participating.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,140
But those three facts together,
do not cover that a particular

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,130
user on a particular team
participate in a particular event.

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,575
That's space is much, much more narrow
than what is illustrated by these.
