1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,660
We are now seeing notation to represent
an impressive number of things,

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,530
relationships, properties,
and constraints among them.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,120
The question is, how do we really
know whether something is a thing,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,020
a relationship, or a property?

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,850
How much does that depend on
the context in which we perceive them?

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,700
A second good question is,
is the EER Model supporting

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,370
all the fundamental types of
abstraction that we would expect,

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,130
including classification,
aggregation and generalization?

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,770
And finally,
why haven't we seen any queries?

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,560
What would the type of
a query on the EER Model be?
