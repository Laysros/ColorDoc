1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,100
So whenever we look at a data model

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,270
we know there are three
things we need to look at.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,230
We need to look at data structures.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,250
We need to look at constraints.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,270
We need to look at operations.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,670
There are two fundamental notations
that can be used to express operations

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,480
in relational databases relational
algebra and relational calculus.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,999
We'll look at both of those.

9
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,910
There are actually two
calculi notations.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,890
One is tuple calculus.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,420
The other one is domain calculus.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,800
In the first case it's tuples of
relations that are the variables.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,380
In the second one it's cells of
domains that are the variables.

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,460
Sequel, or SQL which we will
talk a lot about later,

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,100
is an example of a tuple
calculus language.
