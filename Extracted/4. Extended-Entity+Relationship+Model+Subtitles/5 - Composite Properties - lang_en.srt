1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,100
The next construct I want to show you
is that of a composite property type.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,260
So in this example here again
we have the entity type user.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,420
User has a property of name,
but in this case,

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,260
name is composed from two properties,
namely first name and last name.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,700
So let's look at the instance diagram.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,670
So let's take a look at this user.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,260
This user has a name that's composed
from a first name and a last name.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,630
The first name is Jim,
last name is Smith.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,620
Let's take a look at this user.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,420
This user is Leo, last name Mark.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,850
And finally,
let's take a look at this user here,

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,170
that's Rocky, last name Dunlop.
