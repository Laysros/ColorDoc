1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,354
The next property type we're going to
look at is a multi-valued property type.

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:09,050
Multi-valued property types are modeled
by the the double ellipsis.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,050
So here we have a regular user who has
a multi-valued property type interest.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,560
Let's look at the instance
diagram again.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,780
So here you have your regular users.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,090
There are four instances of those.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,183
Here is a multi-value, so

8
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:28,480
this one multi-value consists
of reading, chess and math.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,470
Those are the interests
of the first user.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,570
This third user he is
interested in biking.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,880
Notice that that's also a multi-value.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,590
That's acceptable,
although it's just one.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,330
The last user here has a whole
bunch of interests, soccer, beer,

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,740
cricket and baseball.
