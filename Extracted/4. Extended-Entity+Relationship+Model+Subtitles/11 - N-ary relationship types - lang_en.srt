1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,030
So far all the relationship types
we have looked at have been binary.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,200
We are now going to look at an N-ary
relationship type with N greater

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,750
than two.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,100
In this case here,

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:16,020
the event team member relationship
type is a ternary relationship type.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,410
It relates three entity types,
regular user, team, and event.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,170
The semantics of this
ternary relationship type

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,760
is somewhat complicated.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,290
Let's try to analyze
exactly what it means.

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,090
Let us fix email to be a single value.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,920
Let us fix event name
to be a single value.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,930
So now we have a pair of one
regular user and one event.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,890
Because this is many on this one
here it means that a particular

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,820
regular user in a particular event
may participate on many teams.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,770
Now let's fix event name and
let us fix team name.

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,970
Again, since these are the identifiers,
event name is going to give us a single

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,320
event, and team name is
going to give us a single team.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,110
Holding onto that pair, you see
that there are many regular users.

19
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,430
Finally, let's now fix an email,
and let's fix a team name.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,990
So now we have a pair of one
regular user and one team,

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,440
and we see here that there are N
events that that particular

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,450
regular user being on that
team may be participating in.

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,160
So the meaning of an instance

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,210
of this relationship type event team
member really is the following.

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,660
A particular regular user on
a particular regular team

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,380
participates in one particular event.

27
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:56,410
The implication of that is,
that you need email and event name and

28
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:03,520
team name to identify precisely a single
instance of this relationship type.

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,870
It's quite rare that you see
examples of relationship types that

30
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,050
are degree higher than two.

31
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,710
I think one of the reasons for that is
that they are difficult to understand,

32
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,350
they are difficult to explain.

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,800
Unfortunately, the problem is,
that it is not always possible

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,580
to take an N-ary relationship
type with N three or greater, and

35
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,970
decompose it into a conjunction
of binary relationships.

36
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,170
We'll look at that next.
