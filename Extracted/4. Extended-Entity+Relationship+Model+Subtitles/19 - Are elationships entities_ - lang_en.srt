1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,120
So the first question is,
are relationships entities, or

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,560
are they just glue that
tie together entities?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,230
So in this example we have two
entity types, employer, and

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,970
regular user, and a relationship type,
current job between them.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,520
And, it's a one to
many relationship type.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,775
Now as you notice,

7
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:25,620
this relationship type has a property
type current job since date.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,310
But, if the relationship
type has a property type,

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,600
isn't it then an entity type?

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,340
If we can accept that relationship
types have properties,

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,070
then fortunately in this one to many
case, there is an acceptable solution.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,690
Take a look at these two
instances of employer.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,810
So in this case here, this employer
here has two regular users,

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,000
this one and this one.

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,730
This second employer here has
three regular users that have

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,700
current jobs under that employer,
this one, and this one, and this one.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,480
You can think about the values of
the properties of the relationship type,

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,068
as values that label the connection
between employer and regular user.

19
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:15,470
So this d1 would be the date,
the current job since date,

20
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,388
of this regular user,
under that employer.

21
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:23,830
And likewise,
d2 would be the current job since date

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,340
between that employer and
that regular user.

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,500
Since these are hierarchies,

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,950
instead of actually labeling
the relationship instances between them,

25
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,730
we could simply move the date d1 down
here, and the date d2 down here.

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,100
It would not be possible
to move the current job

27
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,680
since date up to be
a property of employer.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,620
The reason that would not be possible
is then all the regular users employed

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,700
by that employer would have
to have the same date.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,010
So the solution in this case,
as mentioned here,

31
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,300
is that the current job since date
becomes a property of regular user.

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,750
So basically, this one disappears, and

33
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,490
instead it becomes
a property of regular user.
