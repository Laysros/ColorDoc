1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,560
What needs to happen is the schools
attended need to be an entity type as

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,700
opposed to a relationship type.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,080
We call that an objectified
relationship type.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,650
So, schools attended is
now a relationship type.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,400
The GPA property type is a property
type of that entity type.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,930
Now, we need to model the two
relationship types that are necessary

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,060
in order to get the same
functionality or

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,710
cardinality of the mapping between
the regular user and school.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,220
The way that is done is
that you introduce two,

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,050
one to many relationships.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,860
One from regular user
to schools attended and

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,990
one from school to schools attended.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,730
That functionality,
the two one-to-many relationship type,

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,400
that meet in the middle,
is going to result

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,210
in a many-to-many relationship type
between regular user and school.

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,870
So here we have regular user instances.

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,970
And here we have schools
attended instances.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,830
As you can see,
a regular user here maps to multiple

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,190
schools attended via this
one-to-many relationship type.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,250
Here's another example of that.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,860
Now let's look at school
to schools attended.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,630
Again, that's a one-to-many
relationship type.

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,662
This one maps to one,
which is one example of many.

24
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:22,137
This one here maps to many.

25
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,554
This one here does not map.

26
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:28,604
Now, let's convince ourselves
that this action, in the end,

27
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:33,031
results in a many-to-many relationship,
between regular user and

28
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:36,130
school, exactly like we
were supposed to have.

29
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,700
So take a look at this
particular regular user here,

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,720
how many schools does that user map to?

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,490
Well maps to these two
schools attended and

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,630
this one maps to that school and
this one here maps to that school so

33
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,540
that means that this one
maps to multiple schools.

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,260
Adversely, take a look at
this particular school here.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,610
Here are two of the the instances
of schools attended, and

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,420
this one matched to that user,
this one matched to that user.

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,370
Thus, this school here maps
to multiple regular users.
