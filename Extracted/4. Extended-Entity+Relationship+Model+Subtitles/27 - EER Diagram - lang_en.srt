1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,040
Let's say we want to print a list of
information about regular users and

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,350
the schools they attended.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,770
The information we would like to
come out in the result could be,

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,430
say, their email address,
their first name,

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,680
their last name, and the school name.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,190
And this is for regular users and
the schools they attended.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,120
What's the type of that query?

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,610
Well, it's a list of properties.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,920
But a list of properties is not a type.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,010
It's not an entity type,
it's not a relationship type,

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,080
it's not a super sub type,
it's not a property.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,380
So there is no type to
capture this result.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,010
The essential observation that comes
out of that is that since the result

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,010
doesn't have a type, there is no way
that we can take that result and

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,490
continue to operate on it
with a query language.

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,490
So the query I just asked
does not have a type and

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,270
therefore what I used was
not a closed query language.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,690
Query languages have to be closed.

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,220
It's the only way we can
formulate high level ideas and

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,210
ask high level questions.

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,010
It is actually the reason we don't
run around in loin cloth anymore.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,870
Later on, when we look at relations
database you'll see elegant,

23
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,490
powerful examples of
closed query languages.

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,460
In my opinion the lack of a generally
agreed upon closed query language for

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,210
the extended entity relationship model
is the reason that database management

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,480
systems are not based on the extended
entity relationship model
