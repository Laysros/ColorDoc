1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,390
The next relationship type we
need to talk about is the one

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,330
to many relationship type.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,000
So here we have an example of
a relationship type between employer and

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,990
the regular users that work for
employers.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,680
It's called a one to many relationship
type for the following reason.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,960
Let's look at the surrogate C or
D instances of employer, and

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,360
the instances representing
regular users.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,510
Then it's a one to many, because each
surrogate of employer can be hooked up

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,450
to zero, one, or
more instances of regular user.

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,090
So let me connect a couple more.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,880
So this employer here

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,634
may be the employer that this
regular user works for and

13
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,252
may be the employer that
this regular user works for.

14
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:57,170
This employer here may be the employer
that this regular user works for.

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,680
So when you look at this, being at one
to many relationship type means that

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,420
there's a partial function from
the set of surrogates representing

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,570
regular users to the set of
surrogates representing employers.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,170
It's partial because it's not every
single regular user that's met by it.

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,140
So you see here there are some
regular users that are not working for

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,260
any employer what so ever.

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,700
It is also the case that
there are some employers,

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,700
that do not have any regular
users working for them.

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,000
That's not related to it being
a partial function, of course.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,420
Being a partial function
means that each one of these

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,200
is mapped to at most,
one employer on this side.
