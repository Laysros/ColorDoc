1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,880
The first symbol of the Extended
Entity-Relationship Model I'm going to

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,250
introduce to you is
that of an entity type.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,110
This is a time-invarying
representation of a set of users.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,410
For each one of the symbols that
I'm going to introduce to you,

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,940
I'm also going to show you
what the semantics is.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,580
This symbol is part of
the Extended Entity-Relationship Model.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,660
This is not.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,440
This is just my attempt at
explaining to you what it means.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,870
So at any given point in
time there is a set of users

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,450
that we have captured in our model.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,840
Each one of these dots
represents such a user.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,410
We have previously
talked about surrogates.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,220
Think about these as surrogates.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,420
They are the substance inside the system

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,680
that represent users
out in the real world.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,200
So, here, I got four, seven,
nine users represented.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,330
It is important that within one
entity-relationship diagram,

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,618
All entity type names must be unique.

19
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:08,370
So it is not plausible to have
multiple entity types, for

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,880
example, with the name user.
