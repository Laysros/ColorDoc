1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,310
In this example I'm showing
a relationship type current job

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,710
between employer and regular user.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,610
The point I want to make here
is that the employer may be

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,740
one of two different kinds of entities.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,380
It could either be a company,
which is the employer, or

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,570
it could be a government agency,
which is the employer.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,710
In case the employer is a company,
then an attribute EIN,

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,610
which is a tax identification number, is
needed to be attached with the employer.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,990
In case the employer is the government
agency, then we need an agency ID,

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:43,770
which may be a composite property type
consisting of the agency name and

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,300
which municipality it's in.

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,430
The employer type in this case
is called a union entity type.

13
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,790
So there are two important rules
associated with union entity types.

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,381
The first one is that employer
is a subset of company union

15
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:02,110
government agency.

16
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,824
So, in other words, they are not
going to exist any employers that

17
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:10,855
are not either a company or
a government agency.

18
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:14,578
The second rule is that
the intersection between company and

19
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:16,403
government agency is empty.

20
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:19,482
So it is not plausible
to have an employer,

21
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:24,850
which at the same time is both
a company and a government agency.

22
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,713
So let's take a look.

23
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:29,240
Here's the set of
instances of companies.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,200
Here's the set of instances
of government agencies.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,093
Here's the set of instances of
employers at a given point in time.

26
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:41,480
So let's try to find out what it
means now to satisfy these two rules.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,106
So as you see with this instance
diagram here, we obey the rule that

28
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:53,346
the set of employers must be a subset
of company union government agency.

29
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,429
And you can see, actually in this
case here, there's a proper subset.

30
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:02,293
There is one company in the instance
diagram, which is not an employer.

31
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:07,680
And there are two government agencies
that are not employers in this database.

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,642
However, every single element of
the employer entity type instances,

33
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,940
ie they're from one or from the other.

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,891
Let's look at the intersection here.

35
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:21,362
As you can see, there are none of
the elements in the employer entity type

36
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:24,460
instance set that comes
from both of these types.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,530
So we are also, in this instance,
satisfying this role.
