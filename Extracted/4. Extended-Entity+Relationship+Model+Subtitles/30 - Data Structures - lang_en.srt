1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,930
So let's first talk about data
structures of the relation model,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,260
as opposed to the extended
entity relationship model.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,090
Which had all kinds of notations to
capture structures from entity types,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,580
to property types, to relationship
types, to super sub types, etc.,

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,230
there is only one structure
in relation databases.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,140
Namely, relations.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,280
So guess what you're going to use if
you're going to capture entity types,

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,020
property types, relationship types,
super sub types?

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,590
Yep, you're right,
you're going to use relations.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,500
So a domain is a set of atomic values.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,240
Atomic values that from the point of
view of the database management system,

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,900
has no meaning inside of it.

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,010
In other words nothing
is coded in the values,

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,710
they are just values without
meaning that we want to represent.

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,280
You can think about the set
of atomic values as a type.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,210
Now a relation R is a subset of the set
or ordered n-tuples defined here.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,930
So this set of ordered n-tuples
of which the relation is a subset

18
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,270
is constructed as follows.

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,500
Each one of the elements in the tuple,
in element D I,

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,460
is pulled from
the corresponding domain D I.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,590
It is absolutely essential to
notice that a relation is a set,

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,110
the concept of an attribute is very
important in a relation databases.

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,640
Basically, attribute names
are used to explain or

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,530
to interpret the role of
a domain in a relation.

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,480
A great advantage of having unique
names of attributes within a relation

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,710
Is that now, instead of referring to
the position of a column in a table

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,400
by using the unique attribute name,
you can now refer to it by naming.
