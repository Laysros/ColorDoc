1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,220
A variation of a 1-N relationship

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,140
type is one that's
constraint to be mandatory.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,770
Show you an example of that here.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,200
The bold solid line
signifies that regular user

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,740
mandatorily must
participate in current job.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,850
Let's take a look at what that means
when we look at the instances.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,750
So we have a set of employers over here.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,690
We have a set of regular
users over here.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,390
When you look at this 1-N relationship
type here you see that, for

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,486
example, this employer here
has two regular users working,

11
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:37,904
this one has one, this one has four.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,180
There are a couple of employers here
that have no one working for them.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,830
But notice that all the regular users
that are instances of that type,

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,670
that they must be hooked up via
that relationship to an employer.

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,890
So not only is it a passive function
from regular user to employer.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,330
It's even a total function.
