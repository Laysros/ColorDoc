00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,334
Those of you who are familiar with
object oriented programming languages

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:07,070
are also familiar with
the concept of inheritance.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,060
So take a look at this example.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,510
As before, we have users with subtypes
of RegularUser and AdminUser.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,650
And User has subtypes of Female and
Male.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,228
In general for users,
we have two property types.

7
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:27,080
We have Email, which is the identifying
property type, and we have Password.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,580
So that means that every single
user has an Email and a Password.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,560
Well of course that means that a regular
user will also have an Email and

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,220
a Password.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,120
So will an AdminUser.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,270
So will a Female user and a Male user.

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,600
In contrast to that, RegularUsers
will have BirthDates and CurrentCity.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,730
For AdminUsers, we just record and
store their LastLogin of the AdminUser.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,464
As I mentioned before,
when you look at a RegularUser,

16
00:00:57,464 --> 00:01:00,840
that RegularUser will have an Email and
a Password.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,135
But also immediately visible
will be BirthDate and

18
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:09,250
CurrentCity because these are local
properties of RegularUser.

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,540
When you look at an AdminUser,
that AdminUser will have an Email and

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,750
a Password, but
also the local property LastLogin.

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,890
As opposed to that,
when you look at a User,

22
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,600
the only property types you can
see are Email and Password.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,568
So, for a User,
it is not plausible to see BirthDate,

24
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:33,060
CurrentCity, or LastLogin.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,900
So, we say that regular User and
AdminUser will inherit

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,370
the properties Email and Password,
as will Female users and Male users.
