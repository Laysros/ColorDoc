1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
So, what is it all about?

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,485
The idea is that you are given a relation

3
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:07,200
and a set of functional dependencies like these.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,965
Here's a relation; it has a number of columns,

5
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,790
Email, Interests, SinceAge, et cetera.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,170
And there are some dependencies among these columns so-called functional dependencies,

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,680
we will define them a little bit later.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,790
So, for example, it could be that one functional dependency is that given

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,760
an Email like here that would determine for you what the BirthYear,

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,520
CurrentCity, and Salary are.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,745
So, given the email that would determine birth year,

12
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:39,360
current city and salary could also be that Email and Interest together would determine,

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,295
so these two together would determine the age since when you had that interest.

14
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:49,140
The big question, is this relation laid out in such a manner that it

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,560
is easy to enforce the functional dependencies that we want to enforce in the database?

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,030
An additional question is,

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,465
how do we normalize the relation or decompose it into smaller relations

18
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:06,290
without losing information and without losing functional dependencies?
