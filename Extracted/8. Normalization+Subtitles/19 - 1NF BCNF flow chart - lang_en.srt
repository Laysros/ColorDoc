1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
So, let's take a look at how we can work through normal forms,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,050
and of course we'll continue with the example we've been using.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,385
Here you have the function dependency diagram,

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,345
for our example database.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,275
You have a relation which says,

6
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,755
email and interest in it.

7
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:19,540
Has current city, BirthYear, salary and SinceAge.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,865
Function dependence are as follows;

9
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:25,915
email and interest together determines SinceAge,

10
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:30,280
and email alone determines current city, BirthYear, and salary.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,680
In addition to that,

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,740
salary is also determined by BirthYear.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,310
So, let's take the first step in decomposing that relation.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,900
So, what I want to do is,

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,970
I want to isolate function dependencies that have different left hand sides.

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,260
So, as you see here,

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,250
since email and interest together determines SinceAge,

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,315
that's a good form of dependency to split out.

19
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:55,625
When you split out that function dependency,

20
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,875
you actually also see that at least this portion

21
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:02,995
of the decomposed relation is in boyce-codd normal form.

22
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,565
Why is that? Because the only determinant

23
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,370
of these three is the pay of email and interest,

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,090
and they will have to be a candidate key to enforce that functional dependency.

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,355
What else remains then is,

26
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:20,750
that we need to represent that email determines current city, BirthYear, and salary.

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,555
That's BirthYear by itself determines salary.

28
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:26,980
What form is this relation in?

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,780
Well, it is certainly in second normal reform because all of

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,695
these attributes fully depend on the key, namely email.

31
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,995
But unfortunately, there are transitive dependencies.

32
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:42,450
Email determines BirthYear, which in turn determines salary

33
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,260
resulting in the forced dependency from email to salary.

34
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,970
So, this is not a third normal formulation.

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:55,890
So, let us transform this piece of it and let us isolate out email and current city,

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,575
and BirthYear by itself.

37
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,815
So, you have the first relation here as,

38
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,790
email form determines current city and BirthYear.

39
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,765
What remains then is BirthYear and salary,

40
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,360
that you represent by itself.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,720
So, what normal form are these relations in?

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,290
Well, there are no transitive dependencies outside of the key,

43
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,470
the email attribute here.

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,970
Therefore, this is certainly in third normal reform.

45
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,250
It is also in Boyce-Codd Normal Form,

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,659
because the only determinant in this relation is email,

47
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,970
and email of course is going to have to be the key to

48
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,310
enforce those two forms of dependencies.

49
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,020
So, this relation is now in Boyce-Codd Normal Form.

50
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,355
This relation is of course also in Boyce-Codd Normal Form.

51
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,780
There's no opportunity even for transitive dependencies outside of the key,

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,615
because there's only one attribute outside of the key.

53
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:45,840
So, this one is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form.
