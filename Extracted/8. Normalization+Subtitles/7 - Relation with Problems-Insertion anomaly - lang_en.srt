1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430
A second problem is that of insertion anomalies.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,010
So, let's say we insert a new user,

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,050
like user nine into the database,

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,310
with the user nine information of birth year and current city and salary.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,575
Then, if that user right now doesn't have any interest,

6
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,220
we would have to insert null values here.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,300
Let's say that we would like to insert the information into a database that

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,290
people that have birth year 1970 make 42,000.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,410
Then, we would have to insert null values in all these places if there's currently not

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,080
someone among the regular users that is born in 1970.
