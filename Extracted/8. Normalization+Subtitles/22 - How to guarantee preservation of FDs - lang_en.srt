1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Second question is, how do we guarantee preservation of functional dependencies?

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,575
And here the simple rule is,

3
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:08,365
you're using Armstrong's rules.

4
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:12,225
The meaning implied by the remaining functional dependencies

5
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:16,485
must be the same as the meaning that was implied by the original set.

6
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:23,220
So, looking here at the decomposition of this functional dependency diagram into Email,

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,335
BirthYear and CurrentCity in one relation,

8
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:28,825
and in a separate relation BirthYear and Salary,

9
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:29,970
as you see there.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,315
We can now, by the transitivity rule, see the following,

11
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:36,220
Email determines BirthYear from this relation,

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,980
and BirthYear determines Salary from this relation, and therefore,

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,500
by transitivity, Email determines Salary or as you see here,

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,990
that is implied and therefore,

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,010
the meaning implied by the remaining functional dependencies is the same.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,460
So, in spite of the fact that you do not see Email determining Salary with one relation,

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,050
by the rule of transitivity,

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,800
it's implied by this decomposition.
