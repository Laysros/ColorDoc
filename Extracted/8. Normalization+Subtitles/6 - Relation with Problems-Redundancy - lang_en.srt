1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,315
So, the first problem the relation has, is redundancy.

2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:05,970
Because we repeat it,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,950
all the user1 information;

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,460
birth year, current city,

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,560
and salary, in order to avoid the multi value problem you now have redundant information.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,860
Redundancy potentially leads to inconsistency.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,075
Inconsistency here would appear,

8
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:22,960
if user1 moves say,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
from Seattle to Atlanta but for whatever reason,

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,090
you do not get all the Seattle values updated to Atlanta,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,485
maybe just the first one.

12
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,770
Subsequent to that, users of the database will come in,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,090
and they will look for the current city of user1 and in one place it will say Atlanta.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,555
In other places it will say Seattle.

15
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,840
That means, the database is useless from the point of view

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
of understanding what the current city of the user is.
