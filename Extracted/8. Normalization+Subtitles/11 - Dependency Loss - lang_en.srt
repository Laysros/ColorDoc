00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,755
A similar concept called dependency loss happens as follows.

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:08,455
So again, look at the regular user table and split it up

3
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:12,500
as we did before in these two alternative tables.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,640
Remember, there were a set of functional dependencies that we wanted

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,810
to enforce on this original table here.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,260
When all the information is together in the original table,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,545
it is possible to enforce them.

8
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:29,410
However, when we start decomposing the table into additional tables,

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,095
we may lose the ability to enforce the functional dependencies within a single table.

10
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,250
I have two examples of that here.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,235
One example is that we had a functional dependency from email to salary,

12
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:46,435
since email and salary do not appear together in any of these two new tables,

13
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:48,590
we can't enforce it within a table.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,495
Similarly, birth year determines salary,

15
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:54,250
since the two do not coexist in a table,

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,380
we cannot enforce them in a table.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,050
This is called dependency loss.
