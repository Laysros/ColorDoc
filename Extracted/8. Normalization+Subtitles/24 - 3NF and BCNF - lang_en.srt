00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
So, as I hinted at when I showed you

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,400
the Venn diagram of the sets of different normal formulations,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,595
third normal formulations are

4
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:13,010
a proper subset of the set of Boyce-Codd normal formulations.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,900
That means that there does exist relations,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,490
which using lossless and dependency preserving decompositions,

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,200
can only be normalized to third normal form,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,625
not also to Boyce-Codd normal form.

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:30,880
This only happens in cases where relation has overlapping keys.
