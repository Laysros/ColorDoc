00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
A closely related problem is that of Deletion Anomalies.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,990
So, let's say we go in and we want to delete user12 from the database.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,270
Then deleting user12 will mean that we lose

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,095
the information that people born in 74 make 38,000.

5
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:23,240
Why is that? Because there's no other regular user that's born in 74.
