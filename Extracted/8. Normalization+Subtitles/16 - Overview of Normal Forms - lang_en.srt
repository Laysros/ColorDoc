00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
To help us recognize how well a relation is laid out,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,685
we are going to introduce four normal forms.

3
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:14,635
First, in general, the whole set of data structures is called non-first normal form, NF2.

4
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:19,670
Most of those are not relations in the sense we have defined what a relation is.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,240
A subset of the non-first normal form data structures

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,070
is the set of first normal form relations.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,260
A subset of the first normal form relations is the second normal form relations.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,680
Within the second normal form relations,

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,875
there's a subset of third normal form relations.

10
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,015
As a subset of the third normal form relations is

11
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:43,635
a set of Boyce-Codd normal form relations.

12
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:47,580
Boyce-Codd normal form relations are the relations we are aiming at.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,495
I'm trying to make one additional point with this illustration here.

14
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:56,210
There are certainly first normal form relations that are not in second normal form.

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,380
There also are second normal form relations that are not in third normal form.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,075
However, as illustrated by this small number of

17
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:09,145
relations that are in third normal form but not in Boyce-Codd Normal Form,

18
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:12,330
it is theoretically possible that you have a relation in

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,195
third normal form that's not also in Boyce-Codd normal form.

20
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:18,600
However, in practice, what happens when you

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,990
normalize relations from second normal form to

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,970
third normal form is that you get lucky and actually end up in where we want to be,

23
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,070
namely in Boyce-Codd normal form.

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,480
More about this to come.
