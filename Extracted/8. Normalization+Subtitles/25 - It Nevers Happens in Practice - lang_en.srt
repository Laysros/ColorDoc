1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
As illustrated by the Venn diagram,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,845
this really never happens in practice.

3
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:08,010
I'm going to show you a proof by experience.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,990
Proof has two steps to it.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,500
Number one: it never happened to me in 35 years.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,714
I've designed a lot of databases in industry,

7
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:19,050
in government, and in the university,

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,675
and it never happened to me.

9
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:22,240
As a second part of the proof,

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,335
take a look at one of the bookcases in my office.

11
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:29,545
So, this one bookcase contains data-based textbooks only.

12
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:35,235
Every single one of these textbooks has in it a chapter on database normalization.

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,355
They will show you first normal form,

14
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:39,710
second normal form, third normal form,

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,430
and Boyce-Codd normal form.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,540
Then coming to the bottom of the right page, it says, "However,

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,390
there does exist relations that can only be

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,450
decomposed to third normal form and not Boyce-Codd normal form."

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,080
With shaking fingers you turned the page to see

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,975
such an example and they change the example on you.

21
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,490
Why is that the case?

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,690
Because it takes a really sick brain to construct an example like that.

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,830
So, be confident if you follow the steps and bring relations through first, second,

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,000
third normal form you will be lucky and you will

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
end up in Boyce-Codd normal form in practice.
