1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230
So, let me now define the four normal forms.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,255
A relation I set to be in first normal form if all domain values are atomic.

3
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:12,015
But wait, we defined a relation as a data structure

4
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:15,780
where the domain values are pulled from sets of atomic values.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,905
So in other words, all relations are automatically born in first normal form.

6
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:25,195
A subset of the first normal form relations are in second normal form.

7
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:28,680
They are in second normal form if and only if

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,685
every non-key attribute is fully dependent on the key.

9
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:35,285
So, they are a subset of first normal form,

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,485
and every non-key attribute is fully dependent on the key.

11
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:41,565
A relation is in third normal form,

12
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:43,270
if it is in second normal form,

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,215
and every non-key attribute is non-transitivity dependent on the key.

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,000
Finally, and this is the goal,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,050
this is the desirable normal form for relations to be in,

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,575
a relation is in Boyce-Codd normal form or BCNF,

17
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,955
if and only if every determinant is a candidate key.

18
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:02,670
To understand that, of course,

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,100
we need to define the concept of determinant.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,030
So, a determinant is a set of attributes in a relation on which

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,230
some other attribute is fully functional dependent.

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,400
So, let's take a look at these normal forms,

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,475
and let's see how we progress through each one of the normal forms

24
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:23,750
when we decompose a relation to end up in Boyce-Codd normal form.

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,890
Notice that first, second,

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,685
and third normal form really not our goals in and by themselves.

27
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:34,840
Our goal is to get relations decomposed into Boyce-Codd normal form.
