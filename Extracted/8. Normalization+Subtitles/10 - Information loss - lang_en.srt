1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
So, having seen all the problems with the table we started out with,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,520
the idea is then to try to decompose that table into multiple tables,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,040
so that the function dependencies we talked about

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,950
can be enforced in those without problems.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,860
When we decompose the table into multiple tables,

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,400
we have to be careful though that we do not lose information.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,830
So, look at the regular user table and let us try to decompose it into two tables.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,040
When we do the decomposition,

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,220
we have to include at least one attribute in the two tables,

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,375
so that we can combine them back together to create the table we operated with initially.

11
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:44,310
The basic idea actually is that this may be the information we would like to

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,435
look at but the form it's represented in

13
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:50,775
with all the redundancies is all the problems that come from that,

14
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:54,600
we choose instead to operate with two alternative tables.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,950
But at any point in time we need to be able to

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,540
re-combine them and create this look or this view,

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,065
which is the one we would like to operate with.

18
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,955
So, let's look at the example here.

19
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:10,195
So, we take the regular user table and project it first on the columns,

20
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,180
email, interest, since age,

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,695
birth year, and current city.

22
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:15,390
That gives you this table.

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,630
We then project regular use on current city and salary,

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,035
that gives you this table.

25
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:24,060
Now also, as I mentioned the idea is that when we

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,600
now join this table together with this table,

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,860
we will recreate this table here.

28
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,880
Unfortunately, an interesting thing happens in

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,140
this particular case with this particular decomposition.

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,260
By combining all the tuples in this relation with

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,210
all the tuples in this one we will create all of these.

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,660
But see what happens in addition to that.

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,800
This San Diego here for user3 will be combined with this San Diego here and 38.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,095
Now, let's go look at user3,

35
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:58,770
San Diego 38, that doesn't appear there.

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,890
So, there are two additional tuples added to the result of the join from here.

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,620
Also when you look at you user12, San Diego,

38
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,950
that user is hooked up to 38,

39
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,650
but inadvertently now this San Diego will match this San Diego and 45.

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,005
So in other words, when we join these two together we actually create

41
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:26,535
three additional tuples in the regular user table that were not there before.

42
00:02:26,535 --> 00:02:29,265
This phenomenon is called information loss.

43
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:33,585
You may say, come on that's a bad name for it because I got more information.

44
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:36,075
Well, getting more information that's not

45
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:39,900
reflecting facts of reality is actually information loss,

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,630
because now you're going to have three additional rows here,

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,750
and those rows do not reflect facts in reality.

48
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,340
Therefore, you have lost your ability to distinguish between the true facts that you

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,335
started out with and the false facts that were inadvertently added.

50
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,840
This is called information loss.
