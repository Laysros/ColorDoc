1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
A second definition is that of a full functional dependency.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,090
So again, let X and Y be sets of attributes in R. We say Y is

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,480
fully functional dependent on X if and only if Y is functional dependent on X,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,310
and Y is not functional dependent on any proper subset of X.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,125
So, let's look at the example again.

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,640
In this relation here,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,400
we would like to represent that Email and Interest together determine SinceAge.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,430
That is, SinceAge is not determined by Email alone,

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,825
and you can see that's true because for the three user ones,

10
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,750
the SinceAge has three different values.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,195
Similarly, when you look at the interest,

12
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:46,630
for example music, is associated with different SinceAge values.

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,995
So, SinceAge is in this example fully functional dependent on Interest.

14
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:54,000
Again, as before the question is,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,380
how do we make that continue to be true in this relation?

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,240
Here's an example of a set of forms of

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,265
dependencies that are not full functional dependencies.

18
00:01:03,265 --> 00:01:07,980
So, current city is not fully functional dependent on Email and Interests.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,575
Why not? Because it's dependent on Email alone.

20
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:14,255
So, as you see in this example here,

21
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,540
every single time you give a particular Email address,

22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,090
there is a single city associated with it.

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,915
You do not need Email and Interest together to determine a city.

24
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:29,440
So, these are examples of non full functional dependencies.
