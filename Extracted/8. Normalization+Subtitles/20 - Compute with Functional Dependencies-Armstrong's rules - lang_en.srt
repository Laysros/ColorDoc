1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,145
To make sure that we do not lose information,

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,320
and that we preserve the functional dependencies when we decompose relations,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,850
we need to be able to compute with meaning.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,005
The rules for doing that are called Armstrong's rules.

5
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,705
The first is the rule of reflexivity.

6
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:20,305
All it says is that if Y is part of X,

7
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:24,095
then X determines Y as a function. Very simple rule.

8
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:27,955
Easy example, If Y is part of X,

9
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:31,950
in other words if the right hand side is a subset of the left hand side,

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,875
then the left hand side determines the right hand side.

11
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,855
The second rule is the rule of augmentation.

12
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,665
So, if X function determines Y,

13
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,380
then you can augment it with the same thing on

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,510
the left hand side or you could augment it with the same thing on the right hand side,

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,655
or you could augment it on both sides.

16
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,670
It will be true, in this case,

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,465
when you augment on the left hand side,

18
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:58,040
that WX function determines WY.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,605
To show you an example of that,

20
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:02,365
let's say Email determines BirthYear,

21
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:04,855
then it will also be true that "Email,

22
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,350
Interest" will determine "Birth year, Interest".

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,125
Finally, very importantly, transitivity.

24
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,200
If X function determines Y,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,175
and Y function determines Z,

26
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,505
then X function determines Z.

27
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:20,285
An example of that here is that if

28
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:23,595
Email determines BirthYear, Email determines BirthYear,

29
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:26,770
and BirthYear determines Salary, as you see here,

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,240
then Email will determine Salary by transitivity.
