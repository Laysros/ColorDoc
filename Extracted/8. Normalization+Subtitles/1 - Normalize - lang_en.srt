1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,705
The mapping of EER diagrams to relations

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:07,600
will in all cases be solved in a database which is normalized.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,220
In spite of that, we still have to learn about normalization.

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:25,530
"Databases are forever, they are all I need to please me,

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,315
they can stimulate and tease me,

6
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:33,929
they won't leave in the night,

7
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:42,090
I've no fear that they might desert me. "

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,100
A second reason you need to know how to normalize databases is that

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,440
the EER diagrams they may have been created from may have gone missing.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,410
When you get a database and you look at it for the first time,

11
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,105
it's really like a box of chocolate,

12
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:56,785
you never know what's in there.

13
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,655
So when you look at a database,

14
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:00,760
it may be beautifully normalized,

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,840
designed by experts or it may not be normalized and look like it was designed by idiots.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,680
Although it looks like that,

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,610
it could be because some compromises had to be made in the way

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,290
the database was normalized in order for example to get the database to run faster.
