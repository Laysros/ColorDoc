1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,410
So, that's exactly what I've done here.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,980
You can see user1 is now repeated three times, and 1985, Seattle,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,690
and 27,000 is repeated three times,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,115
and it's done to avoid having this be a multi-value,

5
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,185
and avoid having this be a multi-value.

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,535
So this indeed now is a relation,

7
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:24,310
but it is really a relation with many problems in it.

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,685
So, let us say that in this relation,

9
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:30,910
we want to enforce these three function dependencies that we looked at before.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,960
Or an easier way to see what they are is actually to provide a drawing of them like here.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,365
So, what we are seeing here is that email will determine current city,

12
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:43,155
birth year, and salary,

13
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:48,220
and the pair of email and interest will determine the since age,

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,020
and finally we see that birth year will determine salary.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,910
So that corresponds to those three functional dependencies.

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,470
So, with that relation and with these functional dependencies,

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,490
let's see what kind of trouble we are in.
