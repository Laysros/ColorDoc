00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Kent and Diehr gave us an interesting and funny way

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,685
to remember the first three of these normal forms.

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:08,510
All attributes must depend on the key,

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,960
gives us first normal form.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,600
The whole key, that gives a second reform,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,490
and nothing but the key,

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,255
that gives us third normal form,

8
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:17,630
so help me Codd.

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,120
With references, of course,

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,800
to the inventor of relation databases, Ted Codd.
