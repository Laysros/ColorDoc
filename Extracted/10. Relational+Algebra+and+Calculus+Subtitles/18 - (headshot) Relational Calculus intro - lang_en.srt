1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,015
So we have now looked at relational algebra.

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:08,340
That's one of the two fundamental formalism's for relational database query languages.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,915
The second one is relational calculus.

4
00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:14,405
To distinguish between the two,

5
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:17,285
relational algebra is procedural in nature.

6
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:21,715
It's operator-based and basically what you do is you say,

7
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:25,335
"Take this relation, take that relation, join them together.

8
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:27,660
Take the result of that, do a projection.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,030
Take the result of that, do a selection."

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,530
You're basically describing step-by-step what you're supposed to do to get to the result.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,690
Calculus, in comparison, is declarative in nature.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,375
Instead of saying what to do step-by-step you simply describe the result that you want.

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:50,985
So it may appear that it's a higher level language with more expressive power.

14
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,525
As it turns out,

15
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:55,535
the algebra and calculus were defined in such a manner

16
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:58,895
that with respect to data retrieval of horsepower,

17
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,270
they can actually be shown to be equivalent.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,485
SQL is mostly based on tuple calculus.

19
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:08,590
So, now on to calculus.
