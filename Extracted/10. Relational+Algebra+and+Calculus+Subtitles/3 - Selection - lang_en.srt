1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,575
Let's first look at the selection operator.

2
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:10,380
The general syntax is select all the tuples from relation R that satisfy this expression.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,820
Let's look at an example.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,365
Let's find all RegularUsers.

5
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:17,460
So, there's no subexpression that has to be true here.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,260
So, let's take a look at what the result is.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,970
If this is our RegularUser table with Email,

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,254
Birth Year, Sex, Current City, HomeTown,

9
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,800
and we got one, two, three, four,

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
five to present it right now,

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,580
then the result of that is going to be every single one of the tuples.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,890
Why? Because there was no selection expression.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,950
So, all of them qualify as part of the result.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,570
So, the result of the query is this.
