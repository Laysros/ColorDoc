1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
Now to intersection, so we're going to use

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,850
the same example but this time instead we're going to find

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,010
the cities that are a CurrentCity for some user and a HomeTown for some user.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,670
Not necessarily the same user of course.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,090
So for a City S to qualify,

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,410
there must exist a table in RegularUser that has the CurrentCity as that City.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,720
It must also be the case that there's

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,480
a table t in RegularUser that has that City as the HomeTown.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,275
So what about San Francisco?

10
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,465
Is that going to qualify?

11
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:38,975
Well, San Francisco is certainly a CurrentCity for user four.

12
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:43,360
Is San Francisco also a HomeTown for some user? Yes, it is.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
It is for user six.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,150
So San Francisco is part of the result.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,575
What about San Diego?

16
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:49,825
That's a CurrentCity.

17
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:54,090
Well, it's not part of the result because it's not a HomeTown for anyone.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,685
How about Las Vegas then? Same thing.

19
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:58,390
It's not a HomeTown for anyone.

20
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,885
How about Dallas?

21
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:05,120
Yes, Dallas is part of the result because Dallas is also a HomeTown for someone.

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,200
In this case actually the same one.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,280
So the result is San Francisco and Dallas.
