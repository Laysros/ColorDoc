1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Second, let's take a look at

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,255
an example of the selection operator with a simple expression.

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:11,130
So, let's say we want to find all RegularUsers with HomeTown Atlanta.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,750
The relational algebraic expression is this,

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,565
select where the expression condition is

6
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:20,975
HomeTown equals the value Atlanta from RegularUser.

7
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,060
In general, when we form simple expressions,

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,480
we can do it in one of the following two ways.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,395
We can take an attribute name,

10
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,505
and compare to a constant.

11
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:35,660
The comparison operators are the usual suspects: equal to,

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,215
less than, less than equal to, et cetera.

13
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,795
Or alternatively, we can say attribute

14
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:44,180
one compares to attribute two in the following way,

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,335
either equal to less than,

16
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,260
less than equal to et cetera.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,260
So, let's take a look at the result.

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,185
The first rule here satisfies the requirement that HomeTown equals Atlanta.

19
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:57,245
So, that appears in the result.

20
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:59,150
Second one doesn't.

21
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,155
Third one does.

22
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:03,030
So, that appears in the result.

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,280
Fourth tuple does.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,285
So, that appears in the result.

25
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:08,175
The fifth tuple does not.

26
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:11,665
So therefore, the three tuples that satisfy

27
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:15,615
HomeTown equals Atlanta is what comes back in the result.

28
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:18,760
Notice that all the columns of

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,320
the RegularUser table are also present in the result of the selection query.
