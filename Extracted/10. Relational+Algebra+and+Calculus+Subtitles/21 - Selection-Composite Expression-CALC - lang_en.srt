1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,415
Let's make it a little bit more complicated.

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:06,135
Let's take a look at a selection that has a composite expression.

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:07,785
So, here's what we want to do.

4
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:10,590
Want to find all regular users who have

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,320
the same CurrentCity and HomeTown or who have the HomeTown, Atlanta.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,090
Query is expressed as follows: find a set of tuples r,

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,275
where r is a member of RegularUser and the following is true:

8
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:30,495
either CurrentCity most equal HomeTown or the HomeTown must be Atlanta.

9
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:34,935
This reflects directly what is asked for here namely that the tuple must

10
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:40,305
satisfy CurrentCity is equal to HomeTown or HomeTown equals Atlanta.

11
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:41,970
Looking at the example here,

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,070
see which tuples become part of the result of the query here.

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,600
So, here, is it the case that CurrentCity and hometown is the same? No, it's not.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,185
Well, is it then the case that the HomeTown equals Atlanta?

15
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:55,455
Yes, it is.

16
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:01,040
In other words, this one evaluate to true since this is a disjunction,

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,335
this whole thing evaluates to true,

18
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:05,775
and r is a tuple in RegularUser.

19
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:10,125
So, therefore, the first tuple we looked at satisfies the query,

20
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,610
and so there you go.

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,015
What about the second one?

22
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:16,065
Is HomeTown equal to CurrentCity? Yes, it is.

23
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:19,465
So, user2 is part of the result of the query.

24
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:21,615
Is San Diego equal to Portland?

25
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:25,840
No, it's not. Is hometown equal to Atlanta? No, it's not.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,295
So, as you see, user3 is not part of the result.

27
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:31,925
User4, Hometown is Atlanta,

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,275
user4 in the result.

29
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:38,100
Finally, user10, HomeTown equals CurrentCity,

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,130
is part of the result.
