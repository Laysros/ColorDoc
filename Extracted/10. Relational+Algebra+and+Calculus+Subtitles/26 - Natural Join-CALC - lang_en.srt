1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Next comes Natural Join.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,295
Let's say we want to combine attributes from two different relations.

3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:08,515
So, let's say we want to find e-mail,

4
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:10,460
year, sex, and event.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,130
When the birth year of the regular user is the same as

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,695
the event year of the major 60s events from which these four attributes are poured.

7
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:22,020
So in this case, let's actually take a look at

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,345
the example instead of looking at the queer expression first.

9
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:27,120
So, what do we want to do here?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,995
We want to take the regular user table.

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,540
We want to take the major 60s event table.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,650
Both of those have an attribute year.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,845
So, the Natural Join will combine these two tables,

14
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:41,105
we'll just keep a single copy of the column year.

15
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:43,475
When we turn the e-ma-il,

16
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:46,980
the year, the sex, and the event.

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,245
Now, when is that going to take place?

18
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:51,740
It's going to take place where the year after

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,120
the regular user matches the year of the major 60s event.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,105
So, let's take a look here at the queer expression.

21
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:03,870
So, we are interested in a result that contains: e-mail, year,

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,605
sex, and event, as you can see here,

23
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,785
e-mail, year, sex and event.

24
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:13,845
What must be true for us to generate a tuple in that result?

25
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:18,275
Number one, there must exist a tuple r in regular user.

26
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:21,225
So, down here in this regular use ration,

27
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:25,765
and there must exist a tuple s in the major 60s event.

28
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:28,880
So in other words, our ranges or regular user,

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,815
and s ranges all major events.

30
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:34,595
The join condition for the natural join is that,

31
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,190
the year of r is the same as the year of s,

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,945
so these two must match.

33
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,430
But in addition to that,

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,155
the email address comes from the email r. The year,

35
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:49,290
we picked that from the year of r. The sex,

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,480
we picked that from the sex of r. The event,

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,900
we picked from the event of s. Let's take

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,840
a look at the first tuple in the result user two.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,030
So, user two has birth year 69.

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,365
Sixty-nine matches, let's see, The moon landing.

41
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:12,040
So, those two tuples get combined in the first tuple in the result.

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,940
Let's take a look at user three born in 67.

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,530
Sixty-seven matches this event.

44
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,530
The Doors recording of the Alabama Song.

45
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,340
So, that becomes part of the tuple.

46
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,755
User eight, 68 matches, several tuples.

47
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:32,490
It matches the Tet Offensive year,

48
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,189
it matches the Bloody Sunday year,

49
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,315
and it matches the MLK assassination year.

50
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:43,180
So, user eight gets combined with all those three events.
