00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,635
Closed algebra is the reason we don't run around in loincloth anymore.

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:06,165
Let me show you an example.

3
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:08,820
Here's an expression on rational numbers.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,630
What's the result? Come on,

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,860
you ought to be able to do that.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,785
First, you are Georgia Tech student.

7
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,390
Well, at least you know what to do.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,160
You take the five and the three,

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,450
gives you eight, multiplied by the seven.

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,765
And the result is 56.

11
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:27,325
You subtract 21, you get 35,

12
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:31,270
then you multiply by three, gives you 105.

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,940
Then you add the 10 and five for 15,

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,720
you divide 105 by 15.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,170
Then finally you multiply the seven by the three,

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,705
to give you the final result 21.

17
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:46,350
So, the algebra is said to be closed because each time you do

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,760
an operation on these rational numbers you get a rational number back.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,890
The same type as the operands you started out with.

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,985
That's what a closed algebra is.

21
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:59,170
A closed algebra allows you to formulate higher level models.

22
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,860
So, there's no less than one,

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,400
two, three, four, five, six,

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,710
seven different thoughts involved in this.

25
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,790
Each one built on the next one.

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,885
So, a closed algebra allows you to use

27
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:15,145
previous thoughts to form new thoughts to build high level models.

28
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:20,050
And that is indeed why we don't run around in loincloth anymore.
