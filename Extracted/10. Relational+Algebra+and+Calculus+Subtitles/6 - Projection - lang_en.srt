1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
The next operator is projection.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,600
The Syntax is as follows,

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,960
use the Greek letter pi, and it says,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,090
project from relation R. The following attributes A1, A2,

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,845
up through An, where A1,

6
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:21,260
A2 up through An is a subset of the set of attributes in relation R. So, let's say,

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,805
we want to find email,

8
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:27,960
birth year and sex for all regular users in Atlanta.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,575
So, one way to express their career is the following.

10
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,440
We take a look at the regular user table,

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,280
we find all of those tuples that have

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,365
a hometown equal to Atlanta thus satisfying this requirement.

13
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:46,310
Then after that, we project on the attributes we want;

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,160
email, birth year and sex as expressed up here.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,590
So, which of these regular users live in Atlanta?

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,125
Well, user number one lives in Atlanta,

17
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,025
and what are the email birth year and sex for user1?

18
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:03,870
It's here; email, birth year and sex.

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,820
User4 happens to live in Atlanta too.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,395
So, for user4, we also put in the result email,

21
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:13,305
and birth year and sex.

22
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,685
User number six lives in Atlanta.

23
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:18,080
So, we get user6 email,

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,595
birth year and sex.

25
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:24,230
User10 and user12 do not live in Atlanta.

26
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,450
So, they do not add anything to the result of the query.

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,720
One thing which is very interesting to notice here is not just what projection is.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,110
So, clearly as you can see here with email,

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,750
and birth year and sex,

30
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,780
that is a projection from the state because it leaves out current city and hometown.

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,640
That's what projections do.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,905
What is very, very interesting here with

33
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:50,710
this query refers back to what I talked about earlier,

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,250
that relational algebra is a closed query language.

35
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,405
Because what actually happens here is that this query

36
00:01:57,405 --> 00:02:00,960
here is done in two steps, when we formulated.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,410
First, we take regular user and do a selection from it with a selection condition.

38
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,095
Then from the result of that,

39
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,450
which we know is a relation,

40
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,850
we then do the projection on that.

41
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,360
So, does a composite, query,

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,040
using two operators and this can only be done when your algebra is closed.
