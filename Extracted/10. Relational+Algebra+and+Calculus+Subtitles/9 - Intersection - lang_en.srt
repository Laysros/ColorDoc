1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,865
Second set based operator intersection.

2
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:05,730
Here's an example in English.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,625
Find all cities that are a current city for someone and a hometown for someone.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,165
So, showing that at a Venn diagram,

5
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:15,785
you're looking at the following,

6
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:18,535
say these are the current cities,

7
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,225
these are the hometowns,

8
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:24,635
and since it says both conditions must be satisfied,

9
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:31,040
we're looking for the tuples that satisfy the condition in this intersection.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,320
The query is formulated as follows.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,080
Take regular user project on current city,

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,170
take regular user project on hometown and do the intersection.

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,680
So, take a look at the result.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,770
So, the projection on current city gives you San Francisco,

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,730
San Diego, Las Vegas and Dallas.

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,675
The projection on hometown gives you Atlanta,

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,490
San Francisco, Atlanta and Dallas.

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,685
Except of course, Atlanta is not repeated.

19
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:59,275
Doing the intersection of those will yield the following result.

20
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:03,420
San Francisco is part of the result because it appears both places,

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,255
San Diego is not because it doesn't appear in this,

22
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:10,620
Las Vegas is not because it doesn't appear here,

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,420
Dallas appears over here,

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,045
so that's part of the result.

25
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:16,680
So, the result is this set.
