00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,010
The fourth constructor operator in the relational algebra is Cartesian product.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,685
A Cartesian product simply combines every single tuple into two operands.

3
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:13,350
So, every single regular user tuple will be

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,620
combined with every single user interest tuple.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,965
For example, here, you have user four.

6
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:23,415
User four is going to be combined with every single one of these.

7
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:25,235
For example, this one,

8
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:28,545
as you see, that combination appears here.

9
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:33,695
You might wonder what the usefulness of such a combination would be.

10
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:38,520
After all, there were no comparison rules that would decide when

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,445
two tuples in the operands would be combined in the result, everything is combined.

12
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,480
So, what could that be useful for?
