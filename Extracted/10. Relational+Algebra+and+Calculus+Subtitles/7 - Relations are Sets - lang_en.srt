1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
I want to stress the fact that relation are sets.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,520
So let's say we want to write a query,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,465
find the sex for RegularUsers in Atlanta.

4
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:11,640
The way we could write that is as follows,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,800
select where HomeTown equals Atlanta from RegularUser and then project that on sex.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,610
Let's take a look at the result.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,315
So we have here three tables of users from Atlanta.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,775
When you look at the sex there's one female,

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:28,600
one male, and one female.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,685
So what is the result of that query?

11
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,635
Well, the result is this one.

12
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:38,990
Notice that male appears once and female appears once in spite of

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,465
the fact that two of the tables in RegularUser have sex female.

14
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:47,810
So in other words, relations are sets.

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,370
Again, relation rlgebra is a close clear language.

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,025
You start with a relation,

17
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,495
you end with a relation,

18
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,930
relation is a set.

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,860
Therefore, you only have the two rows male and female.
