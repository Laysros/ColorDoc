00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
Now, let's take a look at the first very,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,120
very simple operation expressed in tuple calculus,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,280
namely that of a selection.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,565
As you will see in the following,

5
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:15,690
I'm using your understanding of relational algebra operators and essentially going

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,250
through some of those in order to show you how they are expressed in tuple calculus.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,155
In that first example,

8
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:27,230
let's try to find all regular users.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,055
The way that's written in tuple calculus is find the set r,

10
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,965
where r is a member of the relation regular user.

11
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,660
In this example here,

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,390
what is it we are attempting to do?

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,770
We are simply attempting to find every single tuple in the relation regular user.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,710
So therefore, the first tuple here is part of the result,

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,555
second tuple is part of the result, et cetera.

16
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:57,190
The result from this operation is identical to the relation we started with.
