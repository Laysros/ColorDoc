1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Now, let's look at set difference.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,975
We're using the same example with slight modifications.

3
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:09,700
Find all cities that are current city for some regular user but exclude

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,875
those that are a hometown for some regular users.

5
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:17,170
Of course, not necessarily the same regular user.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,005
So, we are looking for cities that are found the following way.

7
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:26,825
There must exist a tubule r in regular user that has that city as a current city.

8
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:30,000
But it must also be true that there does not

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,440
exist a tubule t in regular user where that city appears as hometown.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,170
So, let's see here.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,765
What about Seattle?

12
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:41,250
Well, Seattle is part of the result because it appears here as

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,925
a current city and no one has Seattle as hometown.

14
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:47,400
College Park, same thing,

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,245
is not a hometown for anyone.

16
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:52,995
Las Vegas is not a hometown for anyone, so it's in the result.

17
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:56,955
Dallas however is a hometown for someone so it's not in the result.

18
00:00:56,955 --> 00:01:00,975
College Park, we already have that and the result is as said.

19
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:02,250
So the result of the quiz,

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,130
Seattle, College Park and Las Vegas.
