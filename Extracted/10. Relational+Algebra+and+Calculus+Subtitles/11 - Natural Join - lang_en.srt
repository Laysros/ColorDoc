1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Now, let's look at natural join,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,470
the first one of our constructor operators.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,815
So, I'm going to be combining two relations to answer the following query.

4
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:12,040
Find E-mail, Year, Sex,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,990
and Event when the (Birth)Year of the RegularUser is

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,785
the same one as the (Event)Year of the Major60sEvents.

7
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:23,335
So, the algebra query looks like this,

8
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:27,980
take RegularUser, natural join Major60sEvents.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,670
Take a look at the two relations,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,095
here's the RegularUser relation,

11
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:35,310
it has E-mail, Year, and Sex.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,905
Here's the Major60sEvents, it has Year and Event.

13
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,780
What natural join does in combining

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,940
these two tables is it looks at which attribute names are the same.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,735
In this case, Year appears in both tables and no other attributes have the same name.

16
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:58,000
Therefore, the natural join operation is going to compare tuples from

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,560
the RegularUser relation with tuples from

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,070
the Major60sEvents relation and see if the year is the same.

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,195
So, let's see what the result is going to be.

20
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:10,620
So, user1 is born in 1985,

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,465
none of these Major60sEvents happened in 1985.

22
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,750
So, user1 is not going to contribute to the result.

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,030
Let's take a look at user2,

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,570
user2 was born in 69.

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,690
What happened in 69?

26
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,805
Well, we had the Moon Landing happened in 69.

27
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:33,850
So, user2, born in 69, sex, Male,

28
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:40,485
that comes from this tuple is combined with the Moon Landing tuple which appears here.

29
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:44,365
Notice that Year is only recorded one time.

30
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:47,200
User3 is born in 67.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,710
User3, born in 67,

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,050
matches the Year that the Alabama song was recorded by The Doors.

33
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,385
So, those two tuples get combined.

34
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:59,450
User8, born in 68,

35
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,900
matches a number of events: Bloody Sunday,

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,160
the MLK assassination, and the Tet offensive.

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,260
So, all of those get combined.

38
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,465
So, here were some of the properties of a natural join.

39
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:16,985
First of all, it matches values of attributes with the same names and only those.

40
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:20,465
It keeps only one copy of the join attribute.

41
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:24,690
It's called an inner join because only the tuples that actually

42
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,840
appear in the relation and match will appear in the result.

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,320
Those that have no matches will not appear in the result.
