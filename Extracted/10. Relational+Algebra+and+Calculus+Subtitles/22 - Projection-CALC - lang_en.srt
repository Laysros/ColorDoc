1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,945
Next, let's look at projection in tuple calculus.

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:06,409
Let's say we want to find Email, BirthYear,

3
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:09,865
and Sex for RegularUser's with HomeTown Atlanta.

4
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:11,425
So, we write it as follows.

5
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:12,750
We want Email, BirthYear,

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,565
and Sex directly reflecting what is asked for in the projection,

7
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,255
that is of tuples that are in RegularUser,

8
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:21,750
where the corresponding HomeTown equals Atlanta.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,530
Are we going to include in this result user1,

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,955
1985, male? Yes, we are.

11
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:34,805
It's a tuple in RegularUser and HomeTown equals Atlanta.

12
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:39,330
So, user1, 85, and male is part of the result.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,140
What about user4?

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,335
Yes, HomeTown is Atlanta.

15
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,955
What about user6?

16
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:47,385
Yes. What about user10?

17
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:56,010
No. User12? No. So, the result consists of parts of the first three tuples namely,

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,920
the three attributes we are projecting on Email, BirthYear,

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,210
and Sex from those first three tuples,

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,760
user1, user4, and user6.
