1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
Next algebra operator we'll look at is the Rename Operator Rome,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,975
Greek letter for R. Rename is useful when we want to control whether a natural join,

3
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:13,030
a theta join or some other type of join takes place.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,769
As you noticed when I presented the previous three for operators,

5
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:22,485
I was renaming the attributes to make the operator work like it was supposed to do.

6
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:24,960
Here is how to actually make that happen.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,855
The formal syntax for renaming is as follows.

8
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:30,345
Row followed by the following expression.

9
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:33,840
What's in that expression is the name of the relation as it

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,530
currently is and the name of the result relation after renaming.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,980
In the subscript here is the list of attributes that get renamed.

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,820
So we are renaming sex to gender and birth year to year.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,200
Let's take a look at it. So we start out with

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,395
the regular user relation and we rename it to Ruser as you see there.

15
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:58,005
Then, sex is renamed to gender.

16
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:02,055
You see that here and birth year is renamed to year.

17
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:04,300
You see that here.
