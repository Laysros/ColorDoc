1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
The third construct to operate off the relation as a bar is outer join.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,265
In this case it's (left) outer Join

3
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:11,040
signified by those two small lines on the join symbol.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
Let's say we want to find e-mail, year,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,885
sex and event for RegularUsers when the birth year

6
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:20,645
of the RegularUser matches the event year of the event.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,830
But let's in addition to that say that we want to preserve

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,275
RegularUser information even if their birth year does not match any event.

9
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:34,020
The Algebra expression will look like this,

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,025
Outer Join RegularUser with Major60sEvents.

11
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:41,080
So, let's take a look at user three first.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,735
User three is born in '67.

13
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:51,425
'67 matches the year that The Doors recorded the Alabama Song.

14
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:56,475
So, user three here gets combined with the Alabama Song,

15
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,655
and the result appears here.

16
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:02,635
User eight who was born in '68

17
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:06,490
will be combined with the three events that happened in '68,

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,910
The Tet Offensive, Bloody Sunday,

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,240
and the MLK assassination.

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,385
So, that is the next,

21
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:16,045
three tables in the result.

22
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:21,585
Together, those first four are called the "inner" part of the query.

23
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:25,740
Now, let's then go take a look at user one and use 10.

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,735
As you see, their birth years do not match anything on the major '60's events table.

25
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:37,500
Therefore there's nothing to match them up with but as we said up in the query here,

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,065
we would still like to preserve the RegularUser information.

27
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:44,880
So, you see here the user one information and

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,840
the user 10 information and in both cases they have a null associated with them.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,565
So that null, this is called The Outer part or signifies the outer part of that result.

30
00:01:57,565 --> 00:02:01,610
So, in this case the (left) outer join I showed you really was

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,185
a natural (left) outer join because we compared same values.

32
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:09,600
It is a special case of the theta-join.
