1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,445
Let's say, we want to run an email blast,

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:06,465
inviting all users to participate in

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,870
interest groups for interest they currently don't have.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,270
Let's see how we can formulate that in tuple calculus.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,380
I actually think it's easier to first explain that on

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,320
the example here and then look at the expression afterwards.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,015
So, what I want to do is I want to combine all emails in RegularUser.

8
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:29,190
I want to combine that with all interests in UserInterests.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,320
So, my results are going to have an Email attribute and an Interest attribute.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,945
So, that's why the result is structured like this.

11
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:42,805
So, let's see which combinations user1 now gets involved in,

12
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:47,200
so user1 let's combine that with the first interest that's Music,

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,585
so is user1 and Music part of the result?

14
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:53,790
It appears not. Why is that?

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,430
Because user1 is already hooked up to Music in the UserInterests.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,335
How about user1 hooked up with Blogging.

17
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:06,380
Is that part of the result? Yes, it is.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,460
As you see up there,

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,130
it's in the Result and user1 hooked up with

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,160
Blogging does not exist down in the current UserInterests.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,635
What about user1 hooked up with Meditation?

22
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,850
Yes, that's part of the result.

23
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,425
It doesn't appear here.

24
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:25,885
What about user1 hooked up with Music?

25
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,115
Well, we already talked about that.

26
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:29,570
That appeared up here.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,590
So, that doesn't add an extra tuple,

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,380
so user1 gets hooked up with two additional interests namely, Blogging and Meditation.

29
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,400
So, user2 gets hooked up with Music,

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,125
not with Blogging because it's already here.

31
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:49,920
Not with Meditation because already here and yes with Music,

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,805
but that's what we started out with.

33
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:54,525
So, User2 is combined with Music.

34
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:57,415
Does user3 get hooked up with Music?

35
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,725
No, because user3 is already hooked up with Music.

36
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:05,385
However, user3 does get hooked up with Blogging and Meditation.

37
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:10,720
So, as you see here, user3 is combined with Blogging and Meditation.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,160
How about user12? Well, user12 doesn't have any current interest at all.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,635
So, user12 gets hooked up with all the interests and they are Music,

40
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:25,240
they are Blogging and they are Meditation and they are Music,

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,015
but we already did that once and the result is a set.

42
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,230
So, now look at the query expression.

43
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,090
So, we are looking for Emails, combined with Interests,

44
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,180
where r is a tuple in RegularUser and s is a tuple in

45
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,845
UserInterests and it is not the case that there exist a tuple t,

46
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:50,060
which is combined from the tuple r and the tuple s.
