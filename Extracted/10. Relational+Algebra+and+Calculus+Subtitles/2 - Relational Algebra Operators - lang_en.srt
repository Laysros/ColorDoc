00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's take a look at the four groups of algebra operators.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,815
First, we have four operators that are all set operators.

3
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:12,165
As you can see here, we got set union between two sets, R n S,

4
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:17,865
set intersection, set difference, and Cartesian product.

5
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:21,710
As you can already guess now from looking just at these,

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,500
it is not all the operators that are fundamental operators,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,895
some of them are derived or composed from others.

8
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,345
Second, we have two special operators.

9
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:37,450
One is a projection operator that you can think of as eliminating columns from a result,

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,275
the second one is a selection operator which you can think of as eliminating rows.

11
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:48,040
The third group is a group of operators that in general are called joins.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,545
These are constructor operations.

13
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:53,775
We have an operator called natural join,

14
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:55,400
we have outer joins,

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,500
there are three of those,

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,855
a left and right and a full and then we have theta-joins.

17
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,495
Find the two additional operators that are quite special,

18
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,660
one is the divideby operator.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,300
Essentially, the divideby operator allows you to do

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,335
something similar to universal quantification in relational calculus.

21
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:18,835
The rename operator, Greek letter r or row.

22
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:23,830
is essentially an operator that allows you to manipulate the names of

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,445
attributes of relations in such a way that you can get your join operators,

24
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:34,340
and your set operators to work in the way you intend them to work.
