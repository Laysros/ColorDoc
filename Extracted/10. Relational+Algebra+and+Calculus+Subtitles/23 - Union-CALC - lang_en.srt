1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Let us now look at Union.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,440
Let us find all cities that are either a CurrentCity or HomeTown for some RegularUser.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,290
So, the cities we're interested in are the following cities.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,175
If there exists a tuple r in RegularUser with a CurrentCity,

5
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,700
then that's part of the result.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:25,530
Alternatively, if there exists a tuple in RegularUser with a HomeTown,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,425
then that's one of the cities.

8
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:29,525
Let's first look at the current cities.

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,805
So, San Francisco is a current city,

10
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:34,005
so it's clearly part of the result.

11
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,015
Las Vegas is part of the result.

12
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,850
Dallas is part of the result.

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,135
College Park, part of the result.

14
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:44,590
What about Atlanta? Yes, part of the result.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,165
What about Atlanta?

16
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:50,085
Well, Atlanta is already there and the result is a set, of course.

17
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:51,590
What about Austin?

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,520
Yeah. Austin is there and part of the result.
