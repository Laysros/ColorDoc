1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,435
Now let's look at Cartesian product.

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:07,230
As you recall Cartesian Product is a very simple way to combine two relations.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,860
So, let's say we want to combine every single tuple of the RegularUser relation,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,915
with every single tuple of the UserInterests relation.

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,240
That query is very easy to write.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,135
It simply consists of Tuples r followed by s,

7
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:24,945
where r is a tuple in RegularUser,

8
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:28,085
and s is a tuple in UserInterests.

9
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:31,370
So, looking at that again for example user

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,000
one gets combined with this user one tuple here.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,155
So, you see here user one '85 is a male,

12
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:44,155
gets combined with user one, music and 10.

13
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:45,880
Take a look at this tuple here,

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,040
where does that come from?

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,800
Well, it's user four '88 and male.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,560
So, that's that tuple here gets combined with everything of these tuples here,

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,610
including the user three, music and 11.
