1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
The second constructor operator we'll look at is theta join.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,070
Let's say we want to find email,

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,520
birth year, sex, event year,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,665
when the birth year of the regular user comes before the event year of the major event.

5
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,620
When we use the theta join for that the join condition

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,605
is that birth year precedes event year.

7
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,890
In contrast to the natural join,

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,975
this would have been an equality,

9
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:27,720
but there is one more difference that we will see in just a second.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,240
So here we have the regular user table again,

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,430
here we have the major events table,

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,635
and let's take a look at when the birth year precedes the event year.

13
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:44,075
So, 85 for user one does not precede any of the 60s event years.

14
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:47,935
So if you look at user2, was born in 69,

15
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:53,690
and 69 does not precede any of the 60s events we have recorded over here,

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,725
so user2 does not contribute to the result.

17
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:00,050
User3 however, was born in 67.

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,770
67 precedes a number of the events in the event table.

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,195
So, let's take a look at it.

20
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:13,370
So 67 precedes the year of the Tet offensive which was 68,

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,170
the bloody Sunday which was 68,

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,200
the MLK assassination which was 68,

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
and the moon landing which was 69.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,565
So, user3 gets combined with all of those events.

25
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:30,770
About user8. User8 was born in 68.

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,440
68 comes a year before 69 and therefore

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,725
user8 gets combined with the moon landing in the lace tubule in the result.

28
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,055
In contrast to the natural join, in this case,

29
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,880
the two join attributes have different names whereas in the natural join,

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,405
they had the same name.

31
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:53,100
Also in contrast to the natural join,

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,240
both of the join attributes will appear in the result.

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,005
Birth year appears, and event year appears.

34
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:05,495
The comparison that's allowed here in the theta join is any of the usual suspects.

35
00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:07,065
Less than, greater than,

36
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:09,500
equal to, different from etc.

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,435
As I mentioned, all attributes are preserved.

38
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:17,070
This is also an inner join because the things in the two tables that

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,780
do not match each other do not contribute to a tubule in the result table.
