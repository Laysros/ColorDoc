1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Finally, let's look at Set Difference.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,300
So, in the query,

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,520
we want to find cities that are a CurrentCity for some RegularUser,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,220
but not also a HomeTown for some RegularUser.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,060
So, looking at the Venn diagram,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,125
we see the following: got a set here corresponding to CurrentCity,

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,130
got a set here corresponding to HomeTown,

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,440
and in the result we are looking for all of those that

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,405
have this CurrentCity but excluding all of these,

10
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:35,510
which in essence just means we're excluding these in here.

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,655
So these out here do not even get to play in the query.

12
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,230
Here's how it's formulated.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,865
Take RegularUser, project it on CurrentCity,

14
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:45,165
take RegularUser, project it on HomeTown,

15
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:47,770
take the latter away from the former.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,735
So, in the example here,

17
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:53,590
Seattle is part of the result because it doesn't appear over here.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,745
College Park is part of the result because it does not appear over here,

19
00:00:57,745 --> 00:00:59,545
same thing with Las Vegas.

20
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:03,060
Dallas is not part of the result because it appears over here.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,825
College Park is not added because it's already over there,

22
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,200
and the result is a set.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,820
So, the result of the query is this.
