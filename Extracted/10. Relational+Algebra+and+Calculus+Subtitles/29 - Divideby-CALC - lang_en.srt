1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Finally, let's look at the Divideby operator.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:11,110
Let's say we want to find emails of all users with at least all the interests of user1.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,785
I think it's easiest to take a look at the example here first.

4
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:21,930
So, user1: are we going to return as part of the result the email address of user1?

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,470
Yes, we are, because user1 certainly does have at least all the interests of user1,

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,195
namely music, reading, and tennis.

7
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,525
So, user1 is part of the result.

8
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:36,655
Is user2 part of the result?

9
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:41,810
Well, we don't even have to think about that because user2 only has two interests.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,510
So, user2 cannot both be interest in music, reading, and tennis.

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,365
How about user3?

12
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,850
Well, user3 is a potential candidate.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,760
There's one, two, three, four user3 tuples,

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,450
and so all we got a check now is that user3 has the interest music,

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,790
reading, and tennis, and it is right here,

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,550
music, reading, and tennis.

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,090
So, user3 is part of the result.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,115
How about user4?

19
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:17,650
Well, user4 does have three interests but only music and reading match,

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,645
DIY does not so user4 is not in the result.

21
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:27,125
Let's try to see how we write the calculus expression to do this.

22
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:33,015
So, the first thing we see is we are interested in tuples R with attribute email.

23
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,685
So, as you see here,

24
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,250
that is the structure of the result.

25
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,055
In order for us to consider a particular tuple R to be part of the result,

26
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:46,240
of course, R has to be a tuple in user interests,

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,410
so in this table here.

28
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,915
So, let us consider in turn all of these tuples in user interests.

29
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:56,070
For example, this user3 tuple.

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,995
For user3 to be in the result it must be the case that for all s' in user interests,

31
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:05,549
either the email is not user1,

32
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,580
or if it is user1,

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,320
then the interests that are here must match

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,475
up with the interests of the tuple we are asking for in this case.

35
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:21,140
Music, reading, and tennis matches music, reading,

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,980
and tennis, and that's why user3 is part of the result.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,650
So, what you see in this inside expression here is that for all s' in

38
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,145
user interest we don't care about the interests that are not hooked up to user1.

39
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:41,110
So, all of these are those that are hooked up to user1,

40
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,770
and what this basically says is there must exist a tuple somewhere in

41
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:52,790
the relation that matches the interests of the user1 tuples.
