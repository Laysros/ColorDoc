1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,935
Mapping super subtype relationships is a little bit more complicated.

2
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:07,925
There are four cases I would like to consider.

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,435
In the first case,

4
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:13,990
the relationship between ET and the two subtypes is mandatory.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:22,305
That means that every single instance of ET needs to be hooked up to ET1 or ET2 or both.

6
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:25,260
However, in this particular situation,

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,270
we are looking at mandatory and disjoint.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,850
So, the constraint here is that ET1 and ET2 are disjoint.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,140
So, the semantics of this case is the following,

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,265
every single ET instance will have an A value and a B value.

11
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:46,620
But we also know that every single instance of ET is hooked up either to

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,095
ET1 or to ET2 as the case might be it's only going to be one of them.

13
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,710
Furthermore, we know that when we look ET1,

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,950
it will inherit attributes A and B,

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,240
and have C as immediate attribute.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,690
When you look at ET2, all values of that will inherit attribute A and B,

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,130
and have D as immediate attribute.

18
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,640
So, in case one, we actually cheat a little bit.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,870
We only create a relation for ET1.

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,990
For ET2, we do not also create a relation for ET.

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,350
So, ET1 will inherit attributes A and B,

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,060
and have immediate attribute C that states relation here, of course,

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,060
the identifier is still A. ET2, similarly,

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,350
will inherit attribute B and have D as an immediate attribute here.

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,020
What then you might ask happens to the ET instead are not related to any of those?

26
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,180
Well, that can happen because it's mandatory.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,110
So, we will in other words,

28
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,795
find every single ET instance with a corresponding A and B value,

29
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:54,610
either in ET1 or in ET2.
