1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,510
A slight variation in the interrelationship diagram and actually makes

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:10,595
a fairly big difference in the mapping is when the constraint is overlapping.

3
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:11,850
So, in other words,

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:19,605
every single instance of ET is either an instance of ET1 or of ET2 or of both.

5
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,080
So, the first option,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,050
which I really do not like,

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,515
is an option where we create one single relation.

8
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:29,020
We could call that relation ET.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,210
It has attribute A and B.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,030
It has attributes C,

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,675
which is representing the attributes for ET1.

12
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,800
One of my attributes, in this case,

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,715
just D used as an example of the attribute of ET2.

14
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,295
Then, it has an attribute called type.

15
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:53,860
Type will say, whether this is an instance that is in ET1 or whether

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:02,210
it's an instance that's in ET2 or whether it's an instance that is in both ET1 and ET2.

17
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,350
There are several reasons I do not like this option.

18
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,600
One is, that when there are instances of ET that is in either.
