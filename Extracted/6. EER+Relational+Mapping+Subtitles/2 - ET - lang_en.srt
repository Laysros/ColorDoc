1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
What I'm going to do here and in every single step of the mapping is that to the left,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,475
I'm going to show you the extended entity relationship modern notation and to the right,

3
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm going to show you fragments of the relations that

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,775
are created by each step of the mapping.

5
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:23,155
So, here the very first and very simple rule we have is,

6
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:26,305
if we have an entity type, give it the name,

7
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:29,625
"ET" then, for that entity type,

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:34,545
we create a relation and that relation gets the same name, "ET".

9
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:38,300
If an entity type ET has a property type,

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,615
single valued property type B,

11
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:45,960
then the relation ET will have B as an attribute.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,630
If an entity type ET has

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,575
a property type A and that property type is an identifying property,

14
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,460
then in the relation ET corresponding to it,

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,405
there will be an attribute A which is an identifying or primary key attribute.

16
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:05,760
So, these steps are very simple.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,245
Unfortunately, it gets a little bit more complicated than that.

18
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:15,300
We have an entity type ET with a composite property type C and

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:22,250
that composite property type C is composed from property type D and E. Then,

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,785
in the relation corresponding to ET that adds two attributes,

21
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:30,495
attribute D and attribute E. You might then ask,

22
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:32,845
what happened to property C?

23
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,100
Unfortunately, in the translation,

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,335
property type C gets lost.

25
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:39,960
That means that the meaning that's expressed by

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,790
the relation will not be as rich as it is here.

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:50,310
Vision for example, that C was name and D was first name and E was last name,

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,850
then and this mapping here you do not really see the concept of name.

29
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,605
You only see the concept of first name and last name.

30
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:03,770
So, one could consider the following alternative way of mapping it.

31
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,770
It would be nice if in relation ET,

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,430
the concept C would continue to appear with

33
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,360
the two components that it consists of D and E. However,

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,510
if you remember back to the way we defined a relation,

35
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,670
we said that a relation was defined as a subset of

36
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,285
tuples that were constructed from domains with atomic values.

37
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:31,230
Now, this would certainly not be a domain with atomic values.

38
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,635
This would actually be a domain where we would have a name and two sub-components on it.

39
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:41,820
The relational model is inherently flat and the languages we are going to look,

40
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,805
relational algebra, calculus and SQL only work when that's the case.

41
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:51,660
So, unfortunately, this is the solution that we have.

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,800
We have lost C.
