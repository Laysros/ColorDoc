1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Next comes Many to Many relationship types.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,530
How do we deal with those?

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,705
Well, we already saw before we could not point from the ET1 side to the ET2 side

4
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:15,800
because that would require a multi-valued reference or pointer from ET1 to ET2.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,165
So, that one is out. Let's try the other side then.

6
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:23,340
Well, from the other side ET2 you would have to have multiple pointers

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,555
pointing to the ET1 side and that's not acceptable either.

8
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:29,125
So, that one is out too.

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,795
So what do we do? Well, here's the solution,

10
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,010
instead of just generating one relation for ET1

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,540
and one for ET2 as we have correctly done here,

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,690
we actually need to generate a separate relation for R. So,

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,515
basically the idea is that from R we will point

14
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:51,920
to the ET1 side and the same for the ET2 side.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,860
It is important to notice that it is the combination of

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,570
attribute A and B that constitute the key of relation R together.

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,345
Why is that important?

18
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,910
Well, it's important because that is

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,030
exactly what enforces a Many to Many relationship type.

20
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,965
It means that for a particular value of A identifying ET1,

21
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:21,200
there will be multiple values of B that are portable and

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,095
the unique combination is going to identify to plane A and vice versa,

23
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:31,590
for each unique value of B there will be an instance of ET2 that is related

24
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,990
to many instances in ET1 and the combination of them is unique.
