1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,550
Now, take a look at how we map one-to-one relationship types to the relational model.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:12,110
We already know from our previous rule how to map ET1 with identifying property type A.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,860
It becomes relation ET1 with primary key attribute A,

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,705
similar thing for ET2.

5
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:23,470
Now, in databases, we are going to need to be able to start, for example,

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,370
with some B values and travel and find

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,720
the corresponding A values via the relationship type R. So,

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,235
in relational database, we need to be able to do the same thing.

9
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,500
So there are basically two ways of doing that.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,310
One way is that in ET1,

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:49,465
we insert the primary key attribute of ET2 as a pointer or a reference from ET1 to ET2.

12
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,620
Now, I can start out with some A values,

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,160
find the corresponding B values,

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,560
go over here, and find them here,

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,025
and then find whatever ET2 minus to add of information.

16
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:03,570
Alternatively, I could of course take the primary key of

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,515
ET1 and insert as a reference in ET2 to point back here.

18
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,845
Again, this will allow me to travel both ways.

19
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:17,325
So, either the first solution here or the second solution are acceptable.

20
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:22,635
There's one particular situation where we would prefer one of these solutions.

21
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:24,060
Let's take a look at that.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,720
Let's say that ET2 has a mandatory participation in relationship type

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,700
R. What that means is that every single instance of ET2 in

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,865
the database must be related by relationship R to ET1.

25
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,085
That means, in other words,

26
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:47,325
there cannot be an instance of ET2 that's not in a relationship with ET1.

27
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:48,990
In that particular case,

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,720
it is not advisable to use this solution.

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,040
The reason being that,

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
since there might be some ET1s that are not related,

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,965
they will have null values here.

32
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,520
This solution is much better because every single

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,450
one of the ET2s are going to be related to ET1,

34
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,720
and therefore there will never be a null value here for that A.
