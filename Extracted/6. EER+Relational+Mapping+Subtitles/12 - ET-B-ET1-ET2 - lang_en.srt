1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Finally, let's look at union type.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,145
So ET is a union type.

3
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:12,470
The semantics of that is as follows: ET is a subset of the union of ET1 and ET2,

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:19,410
and there's the added constraint that the intersection of ET1 and ET2 is empty.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,450
So we know we're going to get a relation for ET1,

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:29,280
and we know it has identifying attribute C. We know we will get one for ET2 with

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,300
identifying attribute D. We know we will have a relation for ET with property type B.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,360
The question now is how do we model this subtype relationship here?

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,615
One way which is sort of a soft hack that works well is the following.

10
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:53,365
We insert an artificial identifier into relation ET.

11
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:57,630
That identifier will then consist either of

12
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,420
what corresponds to C or corresponds to D. Remember,

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,480
that every single element in there comes either from that or

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,655
from that so it will be identified by C or by

15
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:21,100
D. So the ET identifier is a foreign key on the ET-ID and ET both from ET1 and from ET2.
