1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
In Case Four, there is a relationship type,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,225
is not mandatory and disjoint.

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:09,450
An elegant solution to that is this one.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,640
You generate your relations for ET, ET1 and ET2,

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,065
and of course, ET1 and ET2 will inherit A as an identifying attribute.

6
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:22,390
The reason to this is really a beautiful solution is,

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,530
that since this is not mandatory,

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,970
you can have instances of ET that have no corresponding tables in ET1 and ET2.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:38,010
However, when there are tables in ET1 or in ET2 because of the disjointness,

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,940
a table will only be in one of them.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,200
So for an instance here,

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,250
an instance with a corresponding value will either be an ET1 or an ET2.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,400
So there's not even a replication of an A value in the other one that it's not in.
