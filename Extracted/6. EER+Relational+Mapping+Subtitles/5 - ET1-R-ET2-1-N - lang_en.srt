1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,065
Now, let's take a look at how we map one-to-many relationship types.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:08,180
Let us consider the two different options we had before.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,170
In one option, ET1 would be pointing to ET2 and in the other one,

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,620
ET2 would be pointing to ET1. What would that mean?

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,940
In a one-to-many relationship type,

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,585
the instances of the relationship type look as follows.

7
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:28,230
One of those related to many of those,

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,300
one of those again related to many of those.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,680
If we were to choose this first option here,

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,010
what would that mean?

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,080
For each instance of ET1 that would obviously be

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,979
a unique value of A associated with that unique value,

13
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,100
there would have to potentially be multiple pointers or

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,810
references to ET2 just like you can see here.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,890
This one needs to reference 2,

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,465
this one here would need to reference 3.

17
00:00:55,465 --> 00:01:00,855
But remember, again, you cannot have multi-valued in A field,

18
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,110
in a relation; that was exactly the reason we had

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,830
to deal in such a strange way with multi-valued attributes.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,900
So this solution here having multiple pointers as a value of the attribute,

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,265
just does not work.

22
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,750
What about the other solution,

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,030
would that still work?

24
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,460
Yes, that still works because as you can see,

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,940
instances on the ET2 side point to a single value on the ET1 side.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,000
So it's okay here to insert

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,560
the ET1 side reference or to ET1 because it's unique for every single value of B.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,920
So this solution works, that one is out.
