1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,905
In case three, ET is not mandatorily related to ET1 and or ET2.

2
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:10,950
ET1 and ET2 are allowed to overlap.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,470
Let's take a look at the solution for that.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,470
So again this is actually an option,

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,575
you collect all the attributes together,

6
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:23,760
now you may actually have troupers in this single relay's net has A and B values,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,325
but no C or D values because that's not mandatory anymore.

8
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:30,930
For the same reasons as before,

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,570
I just do not like that.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,120
Second solution very similar to the one we used in

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,935
case two is that we generate a relation for ET,

12
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:42,555
a relation for ET1,

13
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:44,380
and a relation for ET2.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:51,185
Attribute A is inherited in ET1 and ET2 as identifying properties.

15
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:57,255
So, both of those will be foreign keys up to the A attribute in ET.

16
00:00:57,255 --> 00:01:03,190
It is now possible to have instances of ET with A and B values where

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,260
the corresponding A value does not exist

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,790
in ET1 or ET2 simply because that's not mandatory.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,360
It is likewise possible to have instances of ET that are in ET1,

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,610
for example in this case here,

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,100
or instances of ET that are in ET2 for example these two relations together.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,570
So, this is really a fairly pretty solution.
