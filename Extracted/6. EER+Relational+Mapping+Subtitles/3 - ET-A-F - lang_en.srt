1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,785
The rules for multi-valued property types are quite special.

2
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:06,370
Let's say we have an entity type, ET,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,885
and it has an identifying property type, A.

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:14,840
Then you know by a previous rule that that results in a relationship,

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,375
ET will attribute A which is then the primary key.

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,110
Your multi-valued property type, F,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,480
is dealt with for each F as follows.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,845
A brand new relation is created.

9
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:33,565
The name of that relation is the name of the entity type, ET-,

10
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:38,245
the name of the particular multi-valued property type we are dealing with,

11
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:40,320
in this case, F. So,

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,080
the name of the additional relation is ET-F.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,375
The property type F results in an attribute in ET-F.

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,460
Together with that attribute,

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,360
we insert the identifying property type for ET and

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,815
then the combination of A and F become a composite key in ET-F.

17
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:10,975
The reason for all of this gymnastics basically is as follows: so, F is multi-valued.

18
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:17,370
We would not be able to just insert F as a property or as an attribute in ET.

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,340
The reason for that is that we don't have multi values in the relational model.

20
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,105
So, we put it in a separate relation together with the identifying property type,

21
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,930
A, and make the combination a key.

22
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,965
The reason that works is that now,

23
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:36,644
for a given instance of ET,

24
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:39,940
it will have a unique value of A.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,790
That unique value of A can now be represented with multiple different values

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,040
of F as long as the combination of the A and F is unique.

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,705
That's the reason for the composite key.

28
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:56,450
Of course, the As for which we record F values

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,120
has to be a subset of the set of As that exist,

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:09,190
so the A attribute in ET F will be a foreign key on attribute A in ET.
