00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,765
When building database applications,

2
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:07,380
the physical database design and the resulting efficiency is very important.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,050
We may have done an outstanding job, designing,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,210
and implementing the database itself,

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,730
and designing and implementing the applications that run on it.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,775
However, if they don't run fast enough to be useful,

7
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:21,670
then it all does not matter.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,120
So, let's take a look at some of the tools that are

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,910
available to physically design the database,

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,375
organize the data, index it,

11
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,770
and get to it fast.
