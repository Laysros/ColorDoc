1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,910
So, now the data is sorted,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,185
as data is in phone books.

3
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:08,490
It should be much much easier to use it to look up a customer.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,970
So, let's say, "I'm going to look up the phone number of Leo Mark."

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,570
All right. So, I open on page number one.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,470
I read through it, a,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,290
a, a, accurate, affordable.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,030
Nope. Leo Mark's not on that page.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,125
Look at the second page.

10
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,345
Attorney, a basket for you,

11
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,410
a best, a better case.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,590
No. Third page, discount,

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,220
upper a, discount, appliance.

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,025
No. Leo Mark is not on their.

15
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:43,380
No, Leo Marks is not there.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,625
No, Leo Mark is not there.

17
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,760
Maybe, I should try another approach.
