1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,135
So, in a binary search the idea was to cut the search space in two every single time.

2
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:09,735
So, I cut it in two here so it's in half of the space,

3
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:11,065
cut that in two,

4
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:13,265
search in the half the space.

5
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:18,480
The idea of a multilevel index is that the multilevel index will allow

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,210
us to cut the search space into much smaller pieces in each step.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,675
So, using the multilevel index,

8
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,975
I can illustrate as follows.

9
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:29,420
You basically take the book,

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,000
but instead of cutting in two you cut magically,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,965
you cut in much smaller pieces like this.

12
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:43,305
Then, one of the pieces is going to qualify for continued search.

13
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:46,430
Let's say that that piece is this piece.

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,930
So see, we don't have half the book left,

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,135
we only have a tiny fraction left.

16
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,225
So, that piece needs to be cut down again.

17
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:58,355
We used the index at the next level and magically,

18
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:00,810
we cut it into smaller pieces.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,520
Drop all of them except for one and we continue the search with that one.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,445
So, continuing to search for that one, again,

21
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,590
we cut it in smaller pieces, and eventually,

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,665
we end up with a piece that may just be a single page.

23
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:21,745
The key value we are looking for is on that page,

24
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:24,100
if it's in the database at all.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,840
So, that illustrates what a multilevel index does for us.
