00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay, so here's the phone book as a heap.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,290
Let's try to see if we can find the phone number of Leomart.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,330
Pull a page out of the heap.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,835
No, it's not on that page.

5
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:13,060
Pull another page out.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,780
No, it's not on that one either.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,925
Pull the next one up.

8
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,890
No, it's not on that one either.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,500
Now sometimes you're lucky when you

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,255
search in a heap and what you're looking for is on the very first page you pull up.

11
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:33,130
Sometimes you're unlucky and it'll be on the very last page.

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,425
If you used a phone book a lot and life is long,

13
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,115
then on the average,

14
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:41,580
you can be pulling up half the pages from

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,480
the heap to find what you're looking for. Thank you.
