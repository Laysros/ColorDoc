1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
So, let's take a look at our very first file organization,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,265
or rather, in this case,

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:10,060
disorganization, because the first one we're going to look at is a heap.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,580
A heap is defined as a file of data that is not sorted,

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,040
so the records sit on a bunch of blocks and there is no sorting among the records.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,720
Any record we're looking for in the whole file could sit on any block whatsoever.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,140
We saw before that good assumptions,

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,275
for our example here,

9
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:31,080
would be to have block pointers that are four bytes,

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,375
four million records with 20 records per block,

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,655
we need about 200,000 data blocks,

12
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:39,970
and the file size is a total of 800 megs.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,635
So, when something is a heap,

14
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:45,950
that basically means that we have to look at the data pages in

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,050
order to determine whether what we are looking

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,425
for is going to be in those data pages or not.

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:55,220
If there's a grand total of N data pages or N data blocks,

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,230
then sometimes, we are lucky and

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,050
the data we are looking for sits on the very first block.

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,105
Sometimes, we are unlucky and it sits on the very last block.

21
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,390
So, on the average,

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,010
we can expect that we have to look at N over

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,030
2 data blocks where N is the total number of data blocks.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,390
So, with 200 data blocks,

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,020
if we are going to look at the average half of those,

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,340
we'll be looking at 100,000 data blocks.

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,445
If each one caused the default of 10 milliseconds,

28
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:28,720
that's going to cost us 16.6 minutes to look up a record in a heap.
