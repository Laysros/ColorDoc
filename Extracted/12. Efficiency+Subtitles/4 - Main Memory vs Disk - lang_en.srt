00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
Using the phone book as a metaphor,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,100
I would like to illustrate the difference between main memory access and disk access.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,360
Main memory access corresponds pretty well to having the book open on a page,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,175
and then process that page.

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:17,010
Let us say that would take me a minute to do.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,015
The question now is how long time would it take me to

7
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:25,815
open the book to have the next page available for processing?

8
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:32,115
There are five orders of magnitude difference between main memory access and disk access.

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,560
So, assuming it would take a minute to read this page.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,485
It would take 200 days to open the book to the next page.

11
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:42,255
So, I read this in a minute,

12
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,390
and then I start opening the book,

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,100
and opening the book,

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,695
would be way into next semester 200 days from now,

15
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:54,380
I got the second page open and I read that in a minute.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,120
That's the difference.
