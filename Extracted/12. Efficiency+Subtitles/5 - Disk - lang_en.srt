00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
In order to get an understanding of how data is sitting on our disk,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,800
let's first take a look at what a disk actually is.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,475
So, in this example here,

4
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,775
you are seeing the insides of a disk.

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,925
The disk has a number of plates or platters.

6
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:17,445
For each one of the plates,

7
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:20,880
there is a read/write head that accesses

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,065
the top of the plate and one that accesses the bottom of the plate.

9
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:30,330
All of these read/write heads are connected together and are operated by an actuator.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,775
So, what the actuator will do in order to move the read/write heads

11
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:39,750
further out or further in on the disk is that this one will turn.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,110
So, when it turns,

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,475
then you will see that this will move further out or it will move further in.

14
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:47,615
All the platters move together.

15
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:51,150
They all sit at the same spindle and they all move together.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,090
So, with the read/write heads in

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,980
a particular position and all of these plates spinning together,

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,605
what passes under the read/write heads is called a cylinder.

19
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:07,285
On each surface, what paces under the read/write head in that position is called a track.

20
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:08,700
So, on the surface here,

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,545
you have a track and you have

22
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:15,550
a corresponding track on every single surface under the same head position.

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,600
That collection of tracks is called a cylinder.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,140
Each surface is split up into a number of sectors.

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,050
A sector is the smallest physical unit

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,645
that could be transported from the disk to main memory.

27
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:31,355
It consists of 512 bytes.

28
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:35,160
Typically though, blocks that will have contributions

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,310
from several sectors on them is what is transferred as unit.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,915
Block typically will be 4K,

31
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,670
in other words, it contains eight sectors,

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,750
or it will be 8K or 16K depending on the type of data we decide to store on the disk.

33
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,400
There are several quite interesting videos out on

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,745
YouTube that shows you disks that are spun open.

35
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,400
Some of them show your head crashes and so on.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Here's one that's interesting.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,290
Go take a look and be impressed when you see how fast

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,860
the read/write head moves in and out in order to transport data.

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,335
So, here's an example of a typical higher end disc pack.

40
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:14,420
It would have four plates.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,950
Therefore, it will have eight read write heads.

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,565
It might have approximately 150,000 tracks per surface.

43
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:24,230
A track might be 1,000 kilobytes.

44
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,170
Total disk capacity might be 12,000 gigabytes.

45
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,240
As I mentioned, a sector is 512 bytes.

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,395
Disks are formatted, if it's highly formatted data,

47
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:36,845
typical block size would be 4K.

48
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:39,990
If you're dealing with fairly large less formatted objects,

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,415
you might go higher than that.

50
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:45,840
Most systems by default will come with block size of 4K.

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,750
Some major systems come with default block size of 8K.

52
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,260
A high end disk pack like this would typically

53
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,095
have a 600 megabyte per second transfer rate.

54
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:58,620
It would run with 10,000 RPMs and it would

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,120
have a latency somewhere between three and four milliseconds.
