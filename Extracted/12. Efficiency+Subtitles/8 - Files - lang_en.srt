00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
So here's an example of a file.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,630
It consists of multiple blocks.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,010
These blocks are linked together by address pointers.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,470
The blocks may not sit right next to each other on disk,

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,120
but when we have seen one block,

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,990
we can use the next pointer to get to the place

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,890
on disk where the second block is et cetera, et cetera.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,040
So those are all the blocks on the file.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,630
Continuing with the example,

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,665
we can assume that block pointers are four bytes in a 32 bit architecture.

11
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:30,070
Let's say, we had four million regular users records

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,490
and we know that we could fit 20 records on a block.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,865
So that means the number of data blocks would be four million divided by 20,

14
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,450
which is 200,000 blocks of data.

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,610
That also means with a block size of 4k,

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,480
it means that the file size here is about 800 megabytes.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,890
Not a big file, not a small one either.
