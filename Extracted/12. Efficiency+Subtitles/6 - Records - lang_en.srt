1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
So now, we know what the disk looks like.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,645
Let us take a look first at how records would be stored on a block on a disk.

3
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:10,380
In order to understand that,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,400
we need to take a look at what is the size of a record?

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,970
How do we even determine that?

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,370
So, let's go back and take a look at one of

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,310
the relations we've been dealing with in our example namely,

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,250
the regular use of relation.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,784
So, in that relation,

10
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:24,995
we have an email,

11
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:28,835
sex, birthdate, current city, hometown, attribute.

12
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:32,735
We defined previously the email to be a varchar 50.

13
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,980
Sex is a single character.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,365
Datetime type is eight bytes.

15
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:41,950
Current city and hometown were both varchar 50s.

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,905
So, if you add these numbers up,

17
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:47,260
50 plus one plus eight plus 50 and 50,

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,070
you end up with a record size of 159 bytes.

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,450
So, here's a block with records allocated from this relation.

20
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,980
So, in position one,

21
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,425
would be the e-mail of the first record.

22
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,610
That would fill out 50 bytes.

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,170
Then, in 51, we would have the single character that represents sex.

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,750
Starting in 52, we have birthdate.

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,275
Then starting in 60,

26
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:12,535
we have the current city.

27
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:14,525
In 110, we have hometown.

28
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:16,380
Then, up at 160,

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,080
we would be ready to start the email of the second record.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,640
So, all in all, each one takes 159 bites.
