1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
So, data in the phone book is sorted.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,460
Let's see how we utilize that in a binary search.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,745
We're going to look for the phone number of Leo Mark.

4
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:11,045
So, we take the phone book,

5
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:15,355
we split it magically in half like here,

6
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:19,350
we look at the entry here through the my right,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,075
it's New Birth Urban International Ministries.

8
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:27,360
So, Leo Mark comes before them.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,250
So, let's split that next piece in half.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,980
All right what does it say here?

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,620
It says friendship.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,110
So, it comes after friendship and we are left with this piece here,

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,525
now let's split that in half,

14
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:52,360
it says here Jesse's flaws.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,960
What comes after that?

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:03,245
Split that in half and we are here at Lloyd's Insurance.

17
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:06,955
So, it's still in the right side here.

18
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:14,775
We'll split that in half and it says Mack Miller, MC Miller.

19
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,920
So, Mack is in the left side.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:26,700
Okay, so here it says magic and here it says,

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:35,940
Maine split that in half and see what we end up with here, Mason.

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,210
All right. We're down pretty small now.

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,725
Split that in half,

24
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,875
let's see which side we are in. All right.

25
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,390
That's Mark's.

26
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,790
So we're getting close. Would you believe it?

27
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:59,270
Right here on the page are the names that start with Mark. Thank you very much.
