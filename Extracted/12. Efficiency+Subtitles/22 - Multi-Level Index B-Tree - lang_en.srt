1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,125
The most popular of the multi-level indices is one called a B plus Tree.

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,230
In a B plus Tree,

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:12,880
all the data is at the bottom and all nodes over that index nodes in multiple levels.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,750
B plus Trees are implemented in many relational database products.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,900
Insertion, deletion, and update operations, of course,

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,660
are provided together with those implementations to

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,665
guarantee that the B plus Tree continues to be balanced.

8
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,555
B stands for balanced.

9
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:31,860
So, if the tree over time would deteriorate,

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,315
so would the search time.

11
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,860
So, it's very, very important that the distance from

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,115
the route to the base level is the same at all times.

13
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:42,040
It is actually quite rare that an overflow at

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,190
a lower level will propagate far up the index.

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,970
Maybe once, maybe twice is what is most common,

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,800
and that in and by itself is rare.
