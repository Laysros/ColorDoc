00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,650
Let us briefly discuss why we should care what amount of

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,230
time it takes to access main memory and to access the disk.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,900
So, main memory access time is typically

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,130
30 nanoseconds or 0.3 times ten to the power of minus seven seconds.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,690
In comparison, disk access time is

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,615
about 10 milliseconds or 10 to the power of minus two seconds.

7
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:27,650
So, in the amount of time that it would take to do a single disk access,

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:34,550
you would be able to do three times 10 to the power of five main memory accesses,

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,290
that is a very large number.

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,660
It is actually so large that when we do cost computations in database access,

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,400
we completely ignore the amount of computing time that spent in main memory and

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,200
we count only disk access time or what is called the I/O cost.
