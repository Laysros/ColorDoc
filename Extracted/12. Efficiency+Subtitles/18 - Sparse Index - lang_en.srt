00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
To use the phone book to illustrate for you how a single level index might work,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,295
we're going to have to make a few changes to that phone book.

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:12,780
You all know that at the top of the phone book is the first key that's

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,150
mentioned on that page listed together with the page number. Let me show you.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,650
So for example, on this page here at the top it says Adairsville, page 25.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,000
What I'm going to do for you is I'm going to build a single level index.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,630
So, here we go starting to build that index.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,470
So, I've now started building an index for the phone book.

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,260
I cut off the key values together with

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,055
the page number at the top of each page and I started putting them in,

11
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,755
in the same order to build my index.

12
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:56,350
So, here's where I am now.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,210
So I build the piece of the index here,

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,600
you see their are key values listed,

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,335
and together with each key value there's

16
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:10,470
the page number for the page on which that key is the first entry.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,550
Now, let's take a look at how we use it to search in the phone book.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,095
So we were looking at Adairsville,

19
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:22,860
Adairsville when I look up in the index appears right here,

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,880
it says page 25,

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,200
I open up to page 25 and right there indeed I

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,615
do see Adairsville is the first key value that appears on that page.

23
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:37,980
I can now look through that page for anything that sits

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,920
between Adairsville and the next entry in the index.
