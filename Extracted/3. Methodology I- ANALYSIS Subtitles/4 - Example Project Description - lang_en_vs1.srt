1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,200
In order to proceed with a description
of the database application development

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,640
methodology, we need an example
project description.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,290
As I stated,
we assume that the business process,

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,520
the documents, tasks, and
system boundary are all

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,220
well known before we can start deploying
the database development methodology.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,550
It certainly would be
preferable to have a group of

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,560
real users to discuss
the requirements with.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,240
Short of that I'm going to go
through a project description

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,260
that represents the customer.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,170
If you don't read that description you
won't be able to get anything out of

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,630
the rest of this course.
