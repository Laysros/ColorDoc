As you know from your
software engineering class,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,470
a waterfall software process, typically
consists of the following phases.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,420
There's a business process design phase,
analysis, specification, design,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,360
implementation, and then followed by
testing, operation, and maintenance.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,500
And then, of course, there's
the management of the whole process.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,440
All of these phases are needed in

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,010
a database application
development methodology also.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,800
However, in this course,
we are only going to look at those that

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,970
are actually unique for database
development, and they are analysis,

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,640
specification, design,
and implementation.
