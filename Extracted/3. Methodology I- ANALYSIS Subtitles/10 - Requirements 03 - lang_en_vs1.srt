1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,580
Immediately after registering,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,950
a new user would be sent
to the edit profile screen.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,680
The edit profile screen contains some
personal information, list of interests,

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,670
their education, and
their professional information.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,240
The basic personal
information contains sex,

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,280
birthday, current city, hometown,
and a list of interests.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,690
Entering the personal information and
hitting save will save that information.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,640
Any number of interests can be added,
one at a time,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,290
by using the add button and
typing the interest in that field.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,810
To add a school,
the new user uses the drop-down menu and

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,720
types in the year graduated,
if applicable, and hit save.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,820
Similarly, to add a new job,
the user enters the information

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,280
by picking from the drop-down,
enters the job title, and says save.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,410
The edit profile screen, obviously, is
going to be solved in potentially many

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,980
types of information being written into
the database, the person's information,

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,150
interests, education information and
profession information.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,210
But, notice that there will
also be information that's

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,540
read from the database.

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,690
For example, because the drop down-list
for school and the drop-down list for

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,170
employer needs to be consoled in
the database to populate the screen.
