00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,110
Coming back from the first detour where
you've familiarized yourself with

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,760
the document that represents
the customers requirements to this

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,920
future database application system.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,080
We are now ready to do analysis.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,640
In the analysis, we are going to
take the customers requirements and

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,990
from those we are going to create
a information flow diagram.
