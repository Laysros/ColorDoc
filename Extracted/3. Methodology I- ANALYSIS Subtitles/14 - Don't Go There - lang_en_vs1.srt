1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,500
Instead of the information
flow diagram modeling clearly,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,540
the requirements of the customer.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,170
As a software engineer or

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,190
computer scientist you might be tempted
instead to think about it as follows.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,605
It's an application,
you got to log on to it.

6
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:17,365
So, there's a log in document and
a log in task.

7
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,305
You got to maintain the data base.

8
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:23,605
There's a bunch of documents involved in
that maintenance, as input and output.

9
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:26,652
And you need to generate
some reports as output.

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,862
So, the application will have three
tasks, login, maintain the database, and

11
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,272
generate the report.

12
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:33,932
Don't do that.

13
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:37,702
That does not model the future
system you're building.

14
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:40,576
There's models programs, code, etc.

15
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:43,122
That's not what you want to do.
