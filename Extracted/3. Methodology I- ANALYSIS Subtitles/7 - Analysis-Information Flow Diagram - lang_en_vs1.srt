1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,130
Here's the notation we're going to
use for an information flow diagram.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,430
The ellipsis represent tasks.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,620
The documents represent input and

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,340
output screens, as you've seen in
the requirements specification.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,480
The arrows represent information flow.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,100
Very importantly, information flow.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,320
Not control flow.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,930
So this is not a flowchart,

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,560
this is a chart that shows potential
information flow through the arrows.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,570
And then finally, the broken line
here represents the system boundary.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,930
So in this example here,
we are implementing a system and

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,450
you can see the boundary of the system
here is what we're implementing.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,670
Inside on that system there is a number
of tasks, task T1, T2, T3 and T4.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,600
There's also a number of documents that
we use to interact with the system, D1,

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,150
D2, D3, D4, etc.

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,100
If you look at document D1,

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,470
then document D1 is an input
document to test T1.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,530
Test T1 may then interact with
the database by writing things in

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,470
the database and
reading things from the database.

20
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,920
Document D2 is both an input and
an output document.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,210
Test T1 will read information from D2,

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,760
will interact with the database
potentially writing in the database and

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,940
reading from the database and
returning information to document D2.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,300
It's possible that a task can
interact with multiple documents,

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,520
as you see here.

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,880
So, as I mentioned before,

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,000
this is an information flow diagram,
not a control flow diagram.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,070
There are some rules of
this symbolic language.

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,350
You never connect two documents.

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,660
You never connect two tasks.

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,850
So these are the only ways that the
document is allowed to be constructed.
