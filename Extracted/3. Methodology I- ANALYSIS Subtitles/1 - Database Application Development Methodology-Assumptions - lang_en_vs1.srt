1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,760
The database application development
methodology was specifically designed

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,890
for applications that
are supported by databases,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,340
it will not work in general for
software development projects.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,980
Furthermore, in order for

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,100
the methodology to work certain
assumptions must hold true.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,010
The assumptions are as follows.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,120
We assume that business
processes are well designed.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,110
We assume that all documents are known.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,850
We assume that tasks are known.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,560
We assume that the system boundary
is known, and we assume that

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,030
one database schema unifying all views
can be designed for the database.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,530
Documents represent
anything that's input to or

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,120
output from the applications
that run on the database.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,285
The tasks represent the processing that
takes place using those input documents,

15
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,735
and generating those output documents,
and

16
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:53,795
appropriately updating
the database in the process.

17
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:58,095
If we cannot create a database
scheme that unifies all the views,

18
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:00,320
then the methodology fails.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,010
Anyone who has been associated with
a database development project

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,430
knows that this is
an incredibly difficult task.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,230
In an organization there
are many many different

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,090
interests that need to be unified.

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,040
People may have different goals.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,230
There may be power struggles involved.

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,510
There might be company
politics involved, etc.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,250
Without a doubt, this is the most
difficult part of the whole process.

27
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,990
You might ask the questions, if it's
that difficult, is that a problem with

28
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,440
the methodology or
is it a problem with the organization?

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,560
It is always a problem
with the organization.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,420
One definition of an organization

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,960
is that it's an entity created
to pursue a shared set of goals.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,260
So if the organization
cannot successfully arrive

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,460
at such a unifying view, then it's
a problem with the organization.
