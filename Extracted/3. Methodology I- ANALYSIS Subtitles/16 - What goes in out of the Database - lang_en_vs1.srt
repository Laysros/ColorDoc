00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,280
Given an information flow diagram,
with documents that are input

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,820
documents to the database or
output documents from the database,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,440
how does one go about creating
a specification of the database?

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,340
When the database discipline was young,
people talked about this as

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,550
the art of database specification,
or the are of database design.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,000
Over the years I have developed this
database development methodology, and

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,520
it attempts to take some of
the art out of the process and

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,500
add in some mechanical steps.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,900
So I have two fundamental questions.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,480
One is, what goes into the database?

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,800
And the second one is,
what comes out of the database?

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,970
Corresponding to each one of these two,
I have two observations.

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,080
First, observations related to
what goes into the database.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,340
So everything in the database
has got to come from somewhere.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,340
It doesn't happen by magic.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,920
And everything on an input document,
must go somewhere

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,820
corresponding with the second question,
I have these two observations.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,340
Everything in the database
should be used for

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,440
something, otherwise why
is it in the database?

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,730
And everything on an output
document must come from somewhere.

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,430
We are now going to proceed by
looking at the documents, and

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,050
using these four observations to help us
create a specification of the database.
