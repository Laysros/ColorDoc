1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,670
We have now looked at the customer's
requirements to this application system.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,960
From those requirements we designed
an information flow diagram.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,790
The next phase in our database
application methodology

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,690
is that of specification.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,360
We are going to concentrate
on specifying the database.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,850
In order to do that, we're going to
look at the input/output documents to

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,340
the system and we're going to use
those to help us design an extended

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,380
entity relationship diagram representing
a specification of the database.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,350
Subsequent to that,
we are then going to look at the tasks

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,130
of the information flow diagram and
from each one of those we are going to

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,940
provide a specification of what the task
will do relative to the input and

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,860
output documents and
the database that we have now designed.

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,153
With a little bit more detail,
the output of the specification

14
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:58,094
phase will be an extended entity
relationship diagram, data formats,

15
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:01,499
constraints, and
then the task decomposition.
