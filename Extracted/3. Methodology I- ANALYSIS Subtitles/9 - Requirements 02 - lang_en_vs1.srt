1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,630
On the register screen the new user
first provides first name and last name,

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:11,650
and then an email and password, together
with a confirmation of that password.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,980
If that email is not previously
used by another user, and

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,500
if the password and the confirmed
password are identical, then the result

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,770
of this will be that a new user is
created with that email and password.

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,750
Should the user join this process,

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,350
remember that he has been
previously registered.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,180
They can push cancel, which would
send them back to the login screen.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,140
Notice that the register document is
an input document to the system, and

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,180
as a result of interacting
with that registration task,

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,240
the information will be
written into the database.
