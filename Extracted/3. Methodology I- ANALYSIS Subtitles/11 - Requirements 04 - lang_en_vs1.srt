1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,320
Let's now see what that looks like
from the view profile screen.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,490
You see that Michael Bluth now has Sex,
BirthDate, Currency, Hometown,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,670
and a list of Interests entered.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,120
He also has two schools entered
one is a college/university,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,790
the other one is a high school.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,690
He has graduated from both.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,690
He also has a job in the tier with a
title Assistant to the Regional Manager.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,770
As you noticed on the previous screen,

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,740
to enter a school there
was a drop-down menu.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,300
Likewise, to enter an employer for
a job there was a drop-down menu.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,760
A number of administrative users
behind the scenes will maintain

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,030
the list of scores and
the list of employers.

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,680
The View Profile screen also
contains a number of links that

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,990
will allow you to go to other screens.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,050
For example, the view friend screen
will show the list of Friends for

16
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,530
this particular user.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,320
Log Out, of course,
will log you out of the system.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,230
The View Pending Requests screen, you
could see the list of friends' requests

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,610
that have not yet
been accepted or rejected.

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,130
And the Edit Profile link will send you
back to the Edit Profile screen that we

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,400
looked at previously.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,710
Notice that the View Profile screen
is not an input to the database,

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,370
it is an output document from
the database where all the information

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,460
about the user's profile has
been read from the database and

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,860
written onto this output document.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,390
There is, of course,
control information here

27
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,300
that leads you to a different screen,
depending on which link you choose.
