00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,700
The output of the analysis phase of
the database application developement

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,900
methodology is
an information flow diagram.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,830
Here is the information flow diagram
that results from our analysis

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,630
of the requirements to the system.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,179
Let's first look at the form Log In.

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,830
So the Log In Form is
an input to the Log In task.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,160
The Log In task reads from the Database
to confirm that the combination of

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,850
email address and password is correct,
and if it is logs in the user.

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,970
The Registration Form
is an input document,

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:39,500
the result of providing the registration
information right in to the Database,

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,280
that information for that new user.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,408
The Profile Edit document is both an
input document and an output document.

13
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:51,965
It's an input document in that
both personal information,

14
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,970
interests, education information, and

15
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,020
professional information is going to be
written in to the Database, potentially.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,120
It's also an output document, because
to populate with school and employee

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,330
information in the Profile document,
a read from the Database is necessary.

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,610
The View Profile document is
simply an output document from

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,510
reading the corresponding
information from the Database.

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,760
Likewise the Friends List is
a read from the Database, so

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,480
the Friends List is
an output document only.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,410
We have not talked about
the Status/Comments document.

23
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,865
It is used for many different things,
for example, viewing the status and

24
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:33,685
updates it serves as an output document.

25
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:37,745
If you want to add a status
update it's an input document.

26
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:41,755
If you want to add comments
about someone's status update

27
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:43,510
then it's an input document.

28
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,560
Read more about that in
the requirement description.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,190
The Friends Search and Results document
is an input and an output document.

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,470
When the search criteria
are given to the search for

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,910
friends database qualified potential
future friends will be read

32
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,670
from the Database and
written on to the document.

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,000
The Friend Request document
is an input document.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,676
The information on it will result in
writes to the Database about the request

35
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:11,929
that has been made.

36
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:16,035
The Pending Friends List Is both
an input and an output document.

37
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,426
It will be populated by
a read from the Database and

38
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:22,173
you taking action starts as accepting or

39
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:26,880
rejecting an invitation will result
in a write in to the database.

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,300
There are several things that
I want to know this year.

41
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,330
First, I followed the syntax and
the rules for

42
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,040
creating information flow
diagrams presented earlier.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,041
Notice, how the names of the
input-output documents in the test very,

44
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:45,910
very closely reflect those that I
used in the requirements document.

45
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,085
The information flow
diagram is just a first,

46
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,030
high-level specification of the system.

47
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,700
As we analyze further
the tasks of the system,

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,990
you will learn much more
about what they need to do.

49
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,660
In spite of that,
it is not necessary to go back and

50
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,310
refine this information flow diagram.

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,998
There's only so
much you can code by boxes and baubles.

52
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:13,660
So, just take this as the first,
top-level specification of the system,

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,800
which will form the basis for
the next phase of the methodology.

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,682
So the information flow diagram clearly
models the system that was described

55
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:23,815
by the customer.
