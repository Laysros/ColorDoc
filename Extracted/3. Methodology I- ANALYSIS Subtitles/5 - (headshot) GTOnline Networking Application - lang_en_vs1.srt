00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,670
I believe in learning by example,
and learning by doing.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,890
That's why there are two parallel
activities in the course.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,650
One is an example,
the other one is the project.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,540
As the example,
we are going to use GTOnline.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,040
That's a lite social networking site,
for networking socialites.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,949
It is a simple networking application
that provides features similar to

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:27,208
those in Facebook and LinkedIn.
