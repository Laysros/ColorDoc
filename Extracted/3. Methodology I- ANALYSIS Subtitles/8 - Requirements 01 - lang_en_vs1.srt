00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,370
Having now read the document that
describes the client's requirements,

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,310
let us now analyze some of those
requirements in more detail.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,970
So all users will log in via
the GTOnline login screen.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,040
Users are uniquely identified
by their email address and

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,710
providing a correct email password
combination and hitting log in,

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,010
the user will be logged into the system.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,310
If a wrong incorrect
combination of email and

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,720
password is presented on the screen,
then the user should be sent to some

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,530
error message, and
back to the login screen to try again.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,640
If a user has not previously logged in,
then he or

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,980
she needs to register first,
by pushing the Register button.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,950
Notice, as the user interacts with the
login screen, the information provided

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,550
is not written into the database
as a result of the login process.

14
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,530
However, the test that checks the login
information will read information from

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,520
the database to make sure that the user
who's about to login in is a valid user,

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,129
and has provided the correct email and
password.

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,010
So this is purely an input document.
