1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
The content information is just one of

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,605
four collections of metadata that's needed in each one

3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:09,050
of the three information packages that are

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,920
prepared during the archival of digital information.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,505
Before I proceed with the presentation of the details of the content information,

6
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:20,330
let me share with you what my real intent is.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,915
My intent is not really to make you understand

8
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:27,755
all the details of this and make you remember all the details of this.

9
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:32,150
My intent merely is to share with you the massive amount

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,695
of metadata that is needed for long-term archival of digital data.

11
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:38,505
Okay. So, here we go.

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:43,155
The first part of the content information is the content data object.

13
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:48,005
The content data object is the bit stream which is being preserved.

14
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:53,785
The representation information consists of structural metadata and semantic metadata.

15
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:57,320
The structure of metadata expresses what the data formats

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,780
and data structures are in the data that's being preserved.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,540
The semantics expresses the meaning with English names and prose,

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,010
and so on, as to what the data that's being preserved really means.

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,320
The content data object description is a human readable data structure description.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,550
It contains the structural types such as whether things are images,

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,770
sound, text, web documents, executables, etc.

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,410
There's a file description.

23
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,560
There's information like access inhibitors, encryption, watermarks,

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,400
etc, access facilitators like time markers,

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,920
lengths, and so on.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,035
The second part of the representation information is environment descriptions.

27
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:41,805
It consists of two things;

28
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,770
software environment and hardware environment.

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,470
The operating system information includes things such as the operating system name,

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,765
the version of it, the location of it,

31
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:53,540
and the documentation of it.

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,110
Then, there's the rendering programs.

33
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,485
What kind of transformation process necessary to allow rendering of the data object?

34
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,925
What's the transformation engine?

35
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,970
Any parameters needed?

36
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,345
What's the input format?

37
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:08,560
The output format?

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
Location of the rendering program?

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,840
Documentation for it, etc, etc, etc.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,135
Metadata about the hardware environment includes location of it, documentation of it.

41
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:22,585
It includes which computation resources are needed,

42
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,280
processor requirements, memory requirements,

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,970
documentation, the storage requirements, and finally,

44
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,480
which peripherals are required and where's the documentation for those peripherals.
