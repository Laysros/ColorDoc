00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,865
There are a number of standards for archival metadata and they are constantly evolving.

2
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:08,250
One that I particularly like is

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,185
the ISO 11179 Specification and Standardization of Data Elements.

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:18,940
Very very informative about what metadata looks like and what kind of metadata is needed.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,215
Then, there's the OAIS reference model I just presented.

6
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:27,690
It exists in newer versions than the one I pointed you to before and it

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,045
includes the process that sits around all the archival activities.

8
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:36,420
It includes extended entity relationship diagrams

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,845
between all the different kinds of metadata that I've talked to you about.

10
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:46,920
Then, there's the OASIS Registry/Repository for XML Schemas.
