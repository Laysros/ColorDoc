00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Today, we are going to talk about archival metadata,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,210
archival metadata is just one of the types of

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,720
metadata that's so important for Information Interchange.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,855
Let me first motivate the topic.

5
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:16,860
The hardware I have used includes Gutenberg hand-set lead types.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,050
This is what they look like when you set them

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,450
up before you put them in the printing press.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,820
I worked in a small newspaper printing house from fifth grade to eighth grade.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,305
Early in college, I used punch card to submit my programs for better processing.

10
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,710
I have of course used record players.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,390
I still have about 6 feet of vinyls.

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,565
VCRs, I may even still have one in my house.

13
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:46,980
In addition to those I've used 8-bit paper tape readers following the punch card error,

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,120
I've used a manual edition machine with anvil,

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,460
I used an old gear computer in Scandinavia with

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,150
an external magnetic drum and 1K of 42-bit double word memory, wow.

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,895
I've used 8-tracks, big reel tape recorders and big magnetic disk packs.

18
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:08,745
Now let's take a look at what hardware you have used.

19
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:11,915
First of all, you have all used the Atari,

20
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,370
you have used to Walkman,

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,235
you've used a Nintendo and you've used the Super Nintendo.

22
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:20,310
Looks like you had more fun than I did.
