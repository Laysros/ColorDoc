1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,665
The preservation description information consists of reference information,

2
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:09,435
context information, provenance information and fixity information.

3
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:14,025
The archival system identification consists of the system ID,

4
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,380
the value, construction method,

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,640
responsible agency and additional information.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,440
There is a global identifier with a value,

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,885
construction method and a responsible agency for that identification.

8
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:31,240
Finally, on the reference information there is resource description,

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,395
existing metadata, and existing records.

10
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:37,875
That brings us to the context information some of which

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:42,320
includes relationships between this object and other objects,

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,760
information about the relationships between

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,175
this object and other manifestations of the same object,

14
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,110
what the type of relationship is.

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,560
The provenance information contains

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,755
the complete history of the information throughout it's lifetime.

17
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:58,470
Where did it originate?

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,880
How was it created?

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,530
What was the history before ingest to the archival system?

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,920
What was the process that was used during the ingest event?

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,375
What's the history of archival rights management?

22
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,955
Each one of these events throughout the lifetime,

23
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:16,030
origin, pre-ingest, ingest, archival retention,

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,080
rights management, will have a name, procedure,

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,895
date, responsible agency, and outcome, and notes.

26
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:27,895
Fixity information refers to the authentication method for the object.

27
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:31,760
Digital signature, watermark, check sum, etc,.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,615
Both the type, procedure,

29
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:37,560
date and result are part of the fixity information.
