1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,405
So, now I've talked about the content information,

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:05,800
the preservation description information,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,355
and I got two more to go just for the archival information package.

4
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:12,750
After that of course,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,580
I would have to talk to you about

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,065
the submission information package and the dissemination information package.

7
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:20,400
I hope that by now,

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,505
I managed to impress on you the massive amount of

9
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:28,720
metadata that's needed for the long-term archival of digital information.
