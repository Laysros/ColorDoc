1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,265
To try to answer that question,

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:08,590
I want to talk with you about preservation metadata and the OAIS information model.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,975
In the late 90's,

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:14,220
at the request of the International Organization for Standardization, IOS,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,985
the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, CCSDS,

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:24,870
started developing an archive standard for long term storage of data in digital form.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,180
Initial report was released in

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,285
1999 for the open archival information system reference model.

9
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:37,800
This model went through very thorough review and got feedback from a number of

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,610
additional organizations outside of the space community such as

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,660
the Library of Congress and Nesson Archives and Records Administration.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,980
That's the model I want to briefly talk with you about today.
