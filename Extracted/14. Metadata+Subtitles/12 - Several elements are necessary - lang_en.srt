00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,255
The creation and evolution of a metadata registry is a very complex process.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,130
To be successful several elements are needed.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,460
The first element is the initial creation of the metadata schemata.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,990
It is very important that this process is done well.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,265
The reason is that software will be developed to access the registry

6
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:24,945
and you don't want that software to be rewritten as the registry evolves.

7
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:31,110
It is sort of an anchor that will hold you back in future evolution of that registry

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,080
so subsequent creation of new metadata schemata must be

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,770
a controlled process so you do not get two radical changes.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,630
A process for the long term

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,755
controlled evolution maintenance as use of the metadata schemata must be created.

12
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,980
Finally, of course, tools must be in place to support

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,900
the development and evolution and control of the metadata registry.
