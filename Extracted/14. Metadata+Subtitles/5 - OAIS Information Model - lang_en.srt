00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,265
Three so-called information packages are important when digital data is archived.

2
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:09,650
The first one is the submission information package.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,890
It is the information that's submitted

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,854
together with the data that's going to be archived,

5
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,290
at the point in time,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,325
that the archive receives this information.

7
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:22,865
Then, an archived information package is prepared,

8
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,630
that's the information package that is used by

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,510
the archive during the period of time the data is in the archive.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,950
Finally, there's a dissemination information package.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,860
Which is the meta data package that is used,

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,600
as portions of the information in the archive is shared with others.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,860
Each one of these information packages consists of three things;

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,440
content information, preservation description information,

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,030
packaging information and descriptive information.

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,590
I'm going to show you some additional detail,

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,310
of the archived information package.

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,040
So, looking first at the content information,

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,320
here are the details of them.
