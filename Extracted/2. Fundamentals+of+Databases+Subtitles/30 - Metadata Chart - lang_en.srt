1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,190
Is a somewhat different rendition
of what I just described to you.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,430
In this, DBA staff includes the three
human roles that I described for

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,200
you before.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,000
The role defined conceptual schema,
internal schema, and external schema.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,370
That's done through the DDL,
or data definition language,

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,130
with statements that
basically define them, and

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,240
the DDL compiler will compile them and
store them in the metadatabase.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,060
With that in place a casual user
can now write an interactive query.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,700
That query is processed
by a query compiler.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,610
It is optimized to find
an efficient way to execute it and

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,290
it's given as a DBA command to
the one time database processor,

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,830
which will execute it together with
other queries on the database.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,370
Looking at application programmers,
they can write application programs,

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,500
which consist of host language code
with embedded database access.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,770
That code is passed to a precompiler and
out of the precompiler comes two things.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,150
Number one, the host language code and
number two, the database queries or

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,150
database manipulation
language statements.

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,050
Those DML statements, are then compiled
and optimized and then combined

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,560
with the complied host link which
code in this complied transaction.

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,350
The compiled transactions
are sent tot the database and

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,181
execute by the run time,
data base process on.

22
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:28,590
Since there may be many concurrent users
on the database, a concurrency control

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,605
sub-system make sure that all
these competing transactions and

24
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:35,905
queries on the database
are executed in a proper order.
