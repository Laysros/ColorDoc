00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,700
Let us first talk about data modeling.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,210
A model represents a perception
of structures of reality.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,200
The data modeling process
has two steps to it.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,620
First, we need to fix a perception
of structures of reality.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,810
And second,
we need to represent that perception.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,570
Database people use two
different languages for this.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,280
One language is the extended
entity relationship model.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,350
Which is good for fixing a perception
of structures of reality.

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,380
And second,
the relational model is good for

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,890
representing this perception
inside a database.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,020
In the data modeling process we select
aspects of reality that are important

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,420
to us while ignoring others and we use
abstraction to organize these aspects.
