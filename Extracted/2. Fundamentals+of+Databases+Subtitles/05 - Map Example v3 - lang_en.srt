1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,140
Now let's look at a more
detailed example of a map,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,730
namely a map of the city of Atlanta,
in the Peach State of Georgia.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,310
What do we see on this map?

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:15,170
Well, we see a lot of interstates here,
285 is part of the interstate system.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,284
You see 85 coming down from northeast.

6
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,908
You see 75 coming down from northwest.

7
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:23,590
You see I-20 going east to west.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,080
There are other smaller roads like,
take a look at this yellow one here.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,930
There's all the major roads, like this
green one here is Georgia 400 but

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,270
it's a different color
from the interstates.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,780
There's some neighborhoods
pointed out like east point here,

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,800
and as you can see there's an alphabet
that's used to your language,

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,680
that's used here to illustrate
to you what reality looks like.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,649
And in that language,

15
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,964
different kinds of roads have different
colors to let you know what they are.

16
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:53,020
You have letters available
to spell names of places.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,620
You've got symbols available
to illustrate there might be

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,610
a forest there.

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,500
It's important to understand that
there might be errors in the model.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,480
So for example, if I were to draw
the following line here, for

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,970
example from here to here,
and pretend that's a road,

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,670
that road probably
doesn't exist in reality.

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,880
So that's an error.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,840
There might be things on
a map like contour lines for

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,930
example, county lines that
are useful when you use the map.

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,480
But really,
they don't represent something,

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,810
which is physically present in reality.

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,836
On this map here I haven't even
mentioned the fact that North is up and

29
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:30,785
it's true to scale.

30
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:34,904
And those were things that users must
have in common in order to be able to

31
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:37,400
communicate through this map.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,593
Now let me illustrate to you why using
a map might be a better idea than

33
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:42,735
experimenting with
a reality model itself.

34
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,579
So let's say I'm going to
launch on The Varsity,

35
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,574
start out here Georgia Tech and
I can see I gotta cross the interstate,

36
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:53,890
and go south about a half a mile to
get to The Varsity on the right.

37
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,990
I actually wouldn't necessarily need a
map, the only thing I would need to get

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,010
to The Varsity is the following, I would
need to know that 285 goes all the way

39
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,170
around the city, and
The Varsity is located inside the city.

40
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,150
So I could start from Georgia Tech
with a big stack of paper and

41
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,260
a couple of pencils and just keep
an eye on every single road I try,

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,310
if I get to 285 turn around,
do something else.

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,730
Try to minimize the number of
times I go on the same road.

44
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,610
There's a finite number of miles of
roads inside of the perimeter so

45
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,390
eventually I will get to The Varsity.

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,560
It may not be today,
but I will get there.

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,380
So you don't always need a map.

48
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,706
