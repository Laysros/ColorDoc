1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,690
So let's talk about
the conceptual schema.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:08,029
The conceptual schema describes all
conceptually relevant, general,

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,780
and time-invariant structural
aspects of reality.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,129
It describes nothing related
to data representation,

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,680
physically organization, access, or use.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,240
Here's an example, you have
the RegularUser table with Email,

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,910
BirthDate, Hometown, LastName,
MaidenName, Sex, and Salary.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,960
At the conceptual level,
the only thing that's visible

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,820
to the query language is this table and
the columns in it.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,631
So you could for example write a query,
select Email, BirthDate and MaidenName

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:44,458
from regular user, where Sex='F' and
Salary is greater than 70,000.

12
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:48,884
You cannot in that query include
anything about how the results

13
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:53,740
are displayed other than in this order,
or how the data is accessed.
