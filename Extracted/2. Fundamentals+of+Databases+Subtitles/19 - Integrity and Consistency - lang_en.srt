1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,670
Integrity and consistency are two highly
desirable properties of databases.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,190
To give you a really great example of
integrity I have a confession to make.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,890
This is how you know me now.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,920
I'm Leo Mark.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,590
My confession is I am
really working undercover.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,110
Leo Mark Christenson,
that is who I really am.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,840
Why?

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,180
Born in Denmark lot of people
with last name Christenson,

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,050
first day of first grade, 21 students.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,920
There were three with
last name Christenson,

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,600
and two with first name Leo.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,330
>From that day on I became Leo Mark.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,000
Integrity has to do with whether
the database reflects reality well.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,190
Consistency has to do
with whether the database

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,170
is without any internal conflicts in it.

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,330
Let's take a look at an example here.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,928
So we have our regular user table.

18
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:52,270
The regular user table has email,
birthday, name, and

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,010
it has current city in it.

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,660
Then we have a user table.

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,140
And in the user table,
we have emails and we have address.

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,540
So let us first talk about consistency.

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,940
Take a look at User 1.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,300
The current city of User 1
is recorded as Atlanta, but

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,680
the address of User 1 is 123 Kent Rd,
in Roswell.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,050
There seems to be inconsistency
between these two.

27
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,840
Let's take a look at another one.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,270
So User 4, current city is Atlanta.

29
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,150
But address is 789 1st St, Roswell.

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,130
Again, there appears
to be inconsistency.

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,030
User 5, that information may be okay.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,623
User 6, that information may be okay.

33
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:37,560
However, since User 1 and
User 4 seem to have inconsistency,

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,420
and in general we don't know
when that inconsistency appears,

35
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,100
this database cannot be used to answer
the question of where does a user live.

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,430
The problem here of course is
that there's some redundancy

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,390
between where a current city is.

38
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,360
And what an address is.

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,970
Now, let's turn our attention
to an example of integrity.

40
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,580
So you all now know that my full
name is Leo Mark Christensen.

41
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,700
User 4 here actually
happens to be my daughter.

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,080
Louise Mark Christensen, funny name.

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,330
She's born in Denmark.

44
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,650
In Denmark children inherit
both the last name and

45
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,410
the middle name of the father.

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,730
So my daughter's cross to bare
in life is that she has a boys

47
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,390
name for a middle name.

48
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,120
So on the morning of her 18th birthday,
the extended family is

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,280
gathered in the kitchen for
breakfast and the phone rings.

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,910
A man's voice on the other ends asks,
is Louis Mark present?

51
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,390
So I hand the phone to my daughter.

52
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,290
She answers several questions,
first yes, no, and

53
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,860
then certainly not,
then she hangs up the phone.

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,330
Who do you think called?

55
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,450
Well, the military called, and the first
question was, are you Louis Mark?

56
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,720
She answers yes.

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,840
Second question was,
have you signed up for services?

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,540
The answer, of course, is no.

59
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,030
And the final question was,
are you not a male?

60
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,590
So the problem in this database here is
that an inference was made that someone

61
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,270
with the name Louise or Louis or
whatever, Mark certainly must be a male.

62
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,300
And therefore this person should
have signed up for services.

63
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,420
Bad integrity.
