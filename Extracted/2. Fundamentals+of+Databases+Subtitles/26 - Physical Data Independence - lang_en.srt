00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,900
The three levels in the part
architecture provides for

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,280
two types of independence.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,890
One is called physical data
independence, and is a measure of how

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,780
much you can change the internal schema
representation of a database without

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,380
changing or affecting the applications
that one on the external schema.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,110
Database technology allows you to
make that separation almost perfect.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,040
It is very similar to the idea of object
oriented programming that supports

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,510
encapsulation, where the implementation
of a class can be changed

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,990
without affecting the applications that
access the class through its methods.
