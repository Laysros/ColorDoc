1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,730
In process modeling we aim at fixing and

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,310
representing a perception
of processes of reality.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,380
As opposed to the structures processes
are not represented inside the database,

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,700
rather they are reflected in
a way we use the database

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,110
through the database management system.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,110
There are two ways in which we can
use the database through the database

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,280
management system.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,190
One is to embed data manipulation
language code inside a program,

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,360
the other one is to use the data
manipulation language directly

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,310
to issue ad-hoc queries on the database.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,970
Let's take a look at what that means.

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,730
If we have program that builds,
for example, a user interface,

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,800
if you have a program that builds
an interface for an application,

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,330
then inside of that program it is
possible to have data manipulation link

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,060
with statements that accesses a data
base, either to up take the data, or

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,629
to retrieve the data and to display
it back through the interface.

17
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,710
Alternatively, it is plausible to use
the data manipulation language directly

18
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,450
to do ad hoc queries on the database,
or ad hoc updates and

19
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,400
maintenance of the database.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,070
The data manipulation language
we are going to use in

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,840
this course is going to be SQL.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,940
You're going to spend major amounts
of time in the course learning

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,300
how to build programs like this and

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,620
how to embed in them SQL statements to
manipulate and maintain the database.
