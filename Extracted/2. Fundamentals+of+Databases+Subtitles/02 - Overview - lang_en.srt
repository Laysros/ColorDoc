1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,250
In this lesson we are going to
provide a high level overview of what

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,689
a database is.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,960
We are going to define a database
as a model of reality.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,340
That raises two important questions.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,620
First question is why use models at all?

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,890
What is so special about models?

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,670
And the second questions is so

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,270
if we do want to use models,
when exactly is it that we would like to

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,040
use a Database Management System
to create such a model?
