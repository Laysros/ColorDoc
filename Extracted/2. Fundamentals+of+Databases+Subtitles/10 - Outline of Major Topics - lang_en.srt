1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,400
Based on the definition of a database
and a Database Management System,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,290
we can now identify the three
major topics of this course.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,000
We'll spend substantial amounts
of time on data modeling.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,540
Likewise, we'll spend substantial
amount of time on process modeling.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,860
Finally, we're going to take
a look at database efficiency.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,760
The reason for that is,
that it is actually possible to do

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,070
data modeling just perfectly and
process modeling just perfectly.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,950
But end up with a database application

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,270
that doesn't run fast
enough to be useful.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,340
Therefore, we need to look at techniques
for making databases efficient.
