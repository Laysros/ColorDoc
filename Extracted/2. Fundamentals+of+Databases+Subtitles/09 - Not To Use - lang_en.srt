1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,070
In spite of the great
functionality supported by

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,650
database management systems,
there are some aspects you want to

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,590
consider before you decide to use
a database management system.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,100
First, the initial investment
in hardware, software and

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,840
training are very high.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,630
Some database management systems
are as big as operating systems.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,690
The hardware that's needed to run large
software systems like that is expensive.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,630
The amount of time that you put into
learning how to learn databases well

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,860
is considerable.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,934
It might also be the case that
the generality that database management

11
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:38,730
software provides you
with is not needed.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,420
Let me give you some examples.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,160
There's substantial overhead for
security, concurrency control, and

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,420
recovery in a database system.

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,110
Maybe you don't need
that level of security.

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,760
Maybe you don't need a large
set of concurrent users.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,350
Maybe recovery is not that important.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,100
Maybe you don't need data
independence because your data and

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,560
your applications are simple and stable.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,570
Maybe you have an application with
serious real time requirements.

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,630
If the database management system
can't run fast enough to meet those,

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,708
then it's useless.

23
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:15,250
Again maybe multiuser
access is not needed, so

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,580
concurrency control is not needed
