00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,820
To give you an example of a data model,
let me use the relation model, and

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,350
let me illustrate to you what data
structures and constraints and

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,290
operations look like in that model.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,910
In the relational model,
data is represented in tables.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,320
Tables have names,
in this case, RegularUser.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,700
Each column has a name,
Email BirthDate, Hometown,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,260
Salary, each one of
the columns has a data type.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,330
In this case,
emails are represented by varchar(50),

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,060
variable length character
strings maximum length 50.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,150
BirthDate is represented over datetime.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,470
Hometown, again over varchar 50.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,930
Salary is represented over
the data type integer.

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,470
A table is set to have columns.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,440
In this case there are four columns.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,740
The number of columns is also
called the degree of the table.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,580
A relation also has a number of rows,
in this case, one,

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,580
two, three, four, five, six,
seven rows in the table.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,810
The table name, column names and

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,450
data types together constitute
the schema of this table.

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,810
The schema represents aspects of
the data that are stable over time.

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,560
In other words,
the schema is not expected to change.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,080
The state of the database
represented by the rows in

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,470
the table reflect aspects that
are dynamic and change overtime.

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,800
So the idea is that whereas
the schema in general

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,780
represents the structure of data,
the rows will represent

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,070
what is the current state of reality
that's modeled by this table.
