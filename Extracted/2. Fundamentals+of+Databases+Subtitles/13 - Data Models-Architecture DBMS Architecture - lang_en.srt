1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,050
In order to do data modeling, we need to
talk about a tool called a data model.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,410
Data models contain formulations to
allow us to express data structures,

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,880
constraints, and operations.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,990
But there are several
additional important aspects

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,940
I want to talk about before we,
later on in the course,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,710
get into details with the two major
data models we're going to talk about,

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,030
namely, the extended entity relationship
model and the relational model.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,250
And other important aspect I
want to briefly talk about,

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,250
is database architecture.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,700
So, it turns out that a database and

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,450
mode of structure of reality
act has several layers to it.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,840
We want to look at
what are those layers.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,900
We also want to take a look at what
the architecture of a database

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,060
management system, to allow us to
create such a database, would be.

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,110
Specifically, we will look at
the ANSI/SPARC 3-Level database

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,010
architecture, and the corresponding
database management system architecture.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,540
Finally, I want to mention metadata.

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,800
What it is and

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,670
why it is so important to make
everything else happen in a database.

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,390
And now on to data structures.
