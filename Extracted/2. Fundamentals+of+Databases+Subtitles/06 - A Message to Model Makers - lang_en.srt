00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,460
Based on the example of a map,
here's my message to model makers.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,240
A model is a means of communication.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,020
The users of a model must have certain

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,570
knowledge in common in order to be able
to communicate through that model.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,140
So our cover of exams of that
where the maps of the world,

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,140
one was that north is up and
other one is true to scale.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,050
Third one is that the colors
have to be right for

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,230
us to understand what it is
that's depicted in the model.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,690
Remember that a model only emphasizes
certain selected aspects of reality.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,940
Namely those that are useful for
the purpose at hand.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,450
A model is described in some language on
the map, we saw a language of symbols,

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,980
letters, etc.,
that reflected aspects of reality.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,110
We all need to agree on and
understand what that language is,

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,350
in order to be able to
communicate through that model.

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,850
Also there can be errors on the map.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,250
There may be things on the map
that are simply incorrect,

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,080
like a road being placed
in the wrong location.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,730
Finally, to enhance
the model there may be

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,920
features in it that do
not exist in reality.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,175
So examples of that would be contour
lines on a mountain, the date line, etc.
