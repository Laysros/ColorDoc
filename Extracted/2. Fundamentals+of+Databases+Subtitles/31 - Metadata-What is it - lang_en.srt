00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,870
Metadata is essential for
making everything happen in a database.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,830
One distinguish between
two kinds of metadata.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,300
One is systems metadata,
the other one is business metadata.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,420
Systems metadata includes
where the data came from,

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,200
how it was changed, how it's stored,
how it was mapped, who owns it,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,460
who has the right to access it, how has
it been used, and usage statistics?

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,940
Business metadata includes, which data
is available, where is it located,

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,660
what does it mean, how can I access it,
are there any predefined reports,

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,670
predefined queries and
our current list of data.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,540
Systems metadata is absolutely critical
to make a database management system

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,340
work and business metadata is
absolutely critical for businesses for

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,810
example, in data warehouse application.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,980
Late in this course we going to
talk about metadata and

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,550
the use offered in data archival.
