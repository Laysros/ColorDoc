00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,740
Third aspect of a data model, namely
operations, let's look at some examples.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,515
First let me give you an example
of database maintenance.

3
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:13,100
Here's a statement that would insert
an additional row in RegularUser.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,071
That row would contain information
about user11, born in '92,

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,214
with a home town Atlanta,
and salary of $12,500.

6
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:27,230
Here's an example of a retrieval of
data from the regular user table.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,189
It has the well known SQL
structures select, from, where.

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,620
So in this case, it's the regular
user table we select from.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,330
We select two columns,
namely Email and BirthDate.

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,760
This one and this one, so
we don't select these two.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,290
And the condition for
selecting the email and birth date

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,923
is that the hometown is Atlanta and
the salary is greater than $12,000.

13
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:56,440
So will user1, born in '85, be selected?

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,480
No, because the salary is
not greater than $12,000.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,050
Will user4, '88,
with hometown Atlanta, be selected?

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,430
Yes, because the salary
is greater than $12,000.

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,890
Will user6, born in '88, be selected?

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,679
Yes, the hometown is Atlanta, and
the salary is greater than $12,000.
