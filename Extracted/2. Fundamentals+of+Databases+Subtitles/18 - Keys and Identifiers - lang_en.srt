00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,010
Next is the concept of Keys and
Identifiers.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,360
Keys are uniqueness constraints.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,440
If, for example,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,400
we decide to make email the primary
key of the RegularUser table,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,530
that means that there won't be any
duplicate email addresses in this table.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,470
That means that email could be used
to uniquely identify regular users.
