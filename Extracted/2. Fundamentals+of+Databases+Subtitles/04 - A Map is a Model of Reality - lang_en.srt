1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,080
So back to the example of
a map as a model of reality.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,750
Here is a map of the world.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,190
But wait, we are always used to north
being up and that's not the case here.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,730
All right,
let's see if we can repair that.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,930
So here it is.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,270
North is now up.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,410
You got South America, you got Africa,
you got Denmark right there.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,450
But wait, there's another problem here.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,400
This one looks like it's
squeezed left to right.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,110
So here's a second
convention we are used to

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,930
when using a map as a model of reality.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,248
And that is that it's true to scale.

13
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:36,211
One more problem,
what is it with all the blue for

14
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:39,410
landmasses here that's
somewhat confusing.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,700
We normally use blue for ocean instead.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,360
Using blue for landmasses would be the
same as if a math teacher used xs and

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,305
ys for function names.

18
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:54,030
And f and gs for variables that
would certainly mess with our minds.

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,220
So here's a map where
everything appears to be right.

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,180
North is up appears to be true to scale.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,540
Although of course, we know that with
this type of projection of a map there

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,390
are always some issues close to
the north pole and the south pole.

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,110
And finally,
we got the color we normally use for

24
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,860
land masses namely green.
