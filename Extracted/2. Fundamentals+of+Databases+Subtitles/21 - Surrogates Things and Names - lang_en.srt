1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,330
Everything is a thing, and

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,840
some things are just that, things,
let me give you some examples.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,830
So there's the pen I'm using here,

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,460
that's a thing it's not a name for
anything.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,260
There's the tablet I'm doing
the reporting on here, that's a thing,

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,570
not a name for anything.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,588
There's the camera that's being
used to record the hand and

8
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:22,890
the writing, that's a thing,
not a name for anything.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,880
But then, there are some things that
also are names of things, when I say

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,910
names, I mean names in a very general
sense, let me give you some examples.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,840
The text string Leo is a thing,
but it is also my first name,

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,990
the text string GTo1 is a text string,
which is the name on my license tag.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,240
And the text string 49 is a thing
which is the name of my age.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,330
Let's say we have a set of
regular users in reality and

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,830
we would like to record email and
name and address for them.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,740
So we create a table in the database
with the columns email,

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,540
name, and address.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,590
Now let's take a look at one of
the rows in that table, the user one,

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,010
Lisa Smith, lives in Roswell.

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,020
Now if you look at the database a couple
of days later, it may say user one,

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,270
Lisa Jones, live in Roswell,
what happened?

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,945
Is that the same User, yes it
probably is, Lisa probably just got

23
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:30,175
married to Mr. Jones and she changed her
last name, but it's still the same Lisa.

24
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:35,387
Couple of days later you take a look
again it says user one, Lisa Jones,

25
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,707
but now the address is
Atlanta instead of Roswell.

26
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:40,377
Is it still the same Lisa?

27
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:45,312
It probably is, she probably decided to
move to Atlanta with her new husband,

28
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:46,478
Mr. Jones.

29
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,430
Few days later, you look in
the database, and it says user two,

30
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,708
Lisa Jones Atalanta.

31
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:58,908
Now is that the same Lisa or is that
a different Lisa who lives in Atlanta?

32
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,068
That's a difficult question to answer,

33
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:04,896
this type of representation is
called Name-Base representation.

34
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:07,298
In a Name-Base representation,

35
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:11,950
you are what is known about you,
no more, no less.

36
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,500
Now let's consider an alternative
way of doing this, so

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,870
we have regular users, we would like
to record email, name, and address.

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,010
However, this time, instead of just
having the three columns, email, name,

39
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,850
and address, in the regular user table,
we add an extra column, user, for

40
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,250
system generated unique identifiers.

41
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,410
These are also called surrogates,
they represent,

42
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,590
inside the system, they represent
the users out in the real world.

43
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,140
So for each instance of user out in
the real world, you have a surrogate or

44
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,710
substance inside the database to
represent that user in the real world,

45
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,990
now, let's reconsider then Lisa.

46
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,160
You have an identifier for
Lisa, a surrogate for

47
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,240
Lisa, that surrogate never changes then,
you have her email user one,

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,270
Lisa Smith or Lisa Jones,
Roswell or Atlanta.

49
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,600
In every single case you can decide
whether the user is the same by

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,130
determining whether the internal system
generated surrogate is the same or not.

51
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,135
You can ask, is this the same user?

52
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:18,235
This even allows email to be changed and

53
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:22,485
you to be able to recognize whether or
not it is the same user.

54
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:26,915
So the problem with this representation
here in the name-base representation

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,605
is that a thing is what
we know about it and

56
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:34,885
we have used here something to
identify things out in reality.

57
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:38,930
But email can change,
Social Security Numbers can change.

58
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,560
In this representation here,
the surrogate-base representation,

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,230
it recognizes that regardless of
what we know about something and

60
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,770
what the values are,
the thing still exists.

61
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,690
[FOREIGN] as Kant stated.
