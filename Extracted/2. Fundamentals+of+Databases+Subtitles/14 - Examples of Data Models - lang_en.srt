1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,960
A data model is not the same
as a model of data.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,870
We define the database to be
a model of structures of reality.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:15,000
A data model is the tool or the formulas
that we use to create such a model.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,840
We should always be talking about
the following three elements,

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,110
when talking about a data model.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,550
Data structures,
integrity constraints and operations.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,180
Let me mention three
examples of data models.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,200
The first one is the entity
relationship model.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,110
We will use this model to fix
a perception of reality in this course.

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,330
Second is the relational
model which we will use to

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,240
implement that model in
a database management system.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,600
Third let me mention
the Hierachical Model.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,730
The Hierarchical Model was the one
implemented in the first data base

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,610
system the IBMIMS data
base system back in 1967.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,260
Interestingly the Hierarchical Model
is also

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,060
the fundamental model on
the XML data bases today.
