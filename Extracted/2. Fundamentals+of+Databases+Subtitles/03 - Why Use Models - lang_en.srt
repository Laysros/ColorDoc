1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,350
So why use models at all?

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,480
Let me give you a couple
of observations.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,230
First, models can be useful
when we want to examine or

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,440
manage part of the real world.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,910
Second, the costs of using a model
are often considerably lower

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,960
than the costs of using or
experimenting with reality itself.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,070
Let me give you som examples
of models of reality.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,510
We're going to be using a map to
talk about several important aspects

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,170
of models of reality.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,490
There are many other examples, however.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,490
How about a model of US economy?

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,170
Such a model would presumably allow
us to plug in ideas of new laws,

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,510
etc., and find out how they
would affect the economy.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,140
One fundamental problem
here would have caused B,

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,820
can we agree on how to build that model.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,520
A second example is that of
a tsunami warning system,

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,180
a system that would allow us to
save human lives, livestock, etc.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,090
Another example is that
of traffic simulation.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,420
Traffic simulation can be used when we
want to make decisions about where to

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,330
build roads.
