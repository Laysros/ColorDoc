00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,440
Constraints represent rules that cannot

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,930
be expressed by the data
structures we just looked at.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,040
Let me give you some examples.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,560
First, we might want emails to be unique
as they are in this example here.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,550
That would allow us to think about
emails as representing unique

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,020
regular users.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,915
So for each user out in the real
world there's a corresponding row

8
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:27,431
in this table here.

9
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:33,200
For example this one user3,
born in 1967, hometown Portland,

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,306
salary 12,000,
represents a unique user in reality.

11
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:42,167
It wouldn't make sense to allow
emails to be null in this case

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:46,090
because that really doesn't
represent anything.

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,660
We might also have
a constraint that says that

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,740
birth date must be after
the first day of 1900.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,650
Finally, we might have a constraint
that says that hometown must be a city

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,370
in the United States.

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,739
Notice that none of these constraints
are expressed by the table structure or

18
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,552
the data types that the column
values are pulled from.

19
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:13,130
That's why I'm saying that constraints
express rules that are not

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,950
expressed by the data structures alone.
