1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's now turn our
attention to architecture.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,310
We'll be talking about
the architecture of a database and

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,660
the architecture of the database
management system that's used to

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,680
create and maintain the database.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,185
The architecture we're going to look
at is called is the ANSI/SPARC.

6
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:17,420
3-Level architecture.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,640
A database is a model of
structures of reality.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,540
It's divided into schema and data.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,330
The schema describes the intention or

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,450
the type of the data, and
the data describes the extension.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,640
This separation between schema and

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,150
data is done because it makes data
access more effective and efficient.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,540
So, for example,
when we want to search for some data,

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,540
we write a query against the schema and
that query will bring back a result of

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,200
all the data that fits the structure of
the schema that were used in the query.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,140
The separation into a single schema and
data however is not the end of it.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,150
If the database only
consisted of schema and

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,769
data, then the schema would have to
describe aspects of what the meaning of

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,920
data is how it's used and
how it's internally organized.

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,700
This would mean that queries against
the database through that schema

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,400
would be able to reference how
the data is physically organized.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,530
The implication of that is If we decide
to change how data is physically

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,240
organized, then the application of
the database would be affected.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,900
Therefore, the ANSI/SPARC 3-level
architecture separates out aspects

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,990
of how data is physically organized into
what is known as an internal schema.

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,460
And data now sits under the internal
schema, such that database access,

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,040
it will appear that it goes through
the schema to access the data, but

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,100
instead what happens is that it goes
through the schema, and the request, or

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,060
chains, is translated to one at
the internal schema level and

30
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,830
data's accessed and
an answer is sent back.

31
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,490
The benefit of this is
that now it's actually

32
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,330
plausible to change
the way data is stored

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,400
without affecting the applications
that run against the schema.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,030
However, a database is used by many
different applications with different

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,580
needs to display data.

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,740
Therefore for each need, for
each application of the database,

37
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,346
we could create an external schema.

38
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,410
Therefore the ANSI/SPARC
3-level architecture

39
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,900
prescribes a third level named
the external schema level that separates

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,530
out aspects of how data is used
by individual applications.

41
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,410
So now you have applications
running against external schema

42
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,910
that represents data in the preferred
format for those applications

43
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,330
requests through the external schema
are then translated to requests through

44
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,210
the conceptual schema, translated to
requests through the internal schema.

45
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,720
Data is accessed and
the response is translated up and

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,930
presented to the application
in the format that it needs.

47
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,530
Turn this illustration 90 degrees,
and you get the three level ANSI/SPARC

48
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,860
database architecture that
people normally see depicted.

49
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,600
You have a conceptual
schema in the middle,

50
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,870
you have an internal schema
implementing that and

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,080
you have a number of external schemata,
one for each major application.

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,930
The conceptual schema concentrates on
the meaning of data, the internal schema

53
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,060
on the storage of data, and the external
schemata on the use of data.
