00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,760
Now let's talk about external schemata.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,360
So an external schema describes part of
the information in the conceptual schema

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,160
in a form that's convenient to
a particular user group's view.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,680
It is logically derived
from the conceptual schema.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,670
Here's an example of a virtual table
that exists in an external schema.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,680
The name of the virtual table,
or the view, is HighPayFemales.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,440
It is defined as the result
of the following query.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,450
The query selects some of the columns
of the conceptual schema table,

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,590
so it selects email, maiden name,

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,540
current city, from regular user,
where the city equals female and

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,660
the salary is greater than 70K,
and it orders it by maiden name.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,070
The create view statement
creates the virtual table

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,110
HighPayFemales in the external schema.

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,950
So in other words,
the virtual table here has attributes,

15
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,890
email, maiden name and current city,
and the name HighPayFemales.

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,360
It's a virtual table.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,870
It's a view into the database.

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,880
It never really exists.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,710
It's just a view or
a window into the database.
