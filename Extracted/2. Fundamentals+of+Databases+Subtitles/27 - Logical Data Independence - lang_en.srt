1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,380
Logical data independence
is a measure of

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,670
how much you can change the conceptual
schema without changing the applications

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,690
that run on the database
over the external schema.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,210
It is more difficult to provide logical

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,240
data independence than it is to
provide physical data independence.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,190
The reason is that the external
schemata against which the applications

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,980
are written.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,420
Those external schemata are logically
derived from the conceptual schema.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,320
So needless to say if you have
an application that accesses a table

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,190
in an external schema and you go
change that table in the conceptual

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,900
schema then it is plausible that
the application will be effected.
